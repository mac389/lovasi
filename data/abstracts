the scientific panel on dietetic products nutrition and allergies of the european food safety authority published an opinion relating to the presence of trans fatty acids in foods and the effect on human health of the consumption of trans fatty acids trans fatty acids like saturated fatty acids raise ldl cholesterol levels in the blood thereby increasing the risk of coronary heart disease the panel concluded that at equivalent dietary levels the effect of trans fatty acids on heart health may be greater than that of saturated fatty acids however current intakes of trans fatty acids are generally more than 10fold lower than those of saturated fatty acids whose intakes in many european countries exceed dietary recommendations the nda panel also evaluated other health effects and concluded that scientific evidence with regards to a possible relationship of trans fatty acid intake with cancer type 2 diabetes or allergies is weak or inconsistent finally the panel advised that there are no analytical methods available to distinguish between trans fatty acids from natural sources and those formed during food processing
typically two different flock managements are employed by basque sheepherders in winter and spring thus seasonal changes in the fatty acid fa composition of idiazabal pdo farmhouse cheeses were studied ewes raw milk cheeses elaborated in winter and spring were collected after 120 days of ripening from 10 idiazabal pdo farmhouses in winter concentrate and conserved forages were fed whereas a parttime grazing system was adopted from spring onward spring cheeses had less p  005 saturated fa and higher p  005 content of unsaturated fa including transfa mainly transvaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid cla branchedchain fa bcfa and n3 fa principal component analysis pca separated winter and spring cheeses into two groups by the combination of two principal components 842 of variance fresh pasture in the diet enhanced desirable fa and lowered atherogenicity index in cheeses supporting the benefits of using a parttime grazing system for the consumer
studies pertaining to trans fatty acids tfa which have been implicated in development of chronic diseases are more relevant in developing countries where nutrition transition is changing traditional habits and practices measuring tfa is an arduous task because of the need for fat biopsies this study identifies a tissue which can be easily accessed for analytical measurement of trans fatty acid in this crosssectional study fatty acid in adipose tissue cheek epithelium and blood samples were assessed by gas chromatography spearman correlation coefficient was computed to study the correlation of fatty acid distribution among the three tissues the correlation coefficient of total trans fatty acid between cheek epithelium and serum was 030002 and between cheek epitheliumand adipose tissue was 033 p 0019 this study is the first to report trans fatty acid profile in cheek epithelium giving scope for utilizing the cheek epithelium as a tissue for objective assessment of trans fatty acid intake
recommendations for decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease include increasing the intake of plant sterols and fish oil the cholesterollowering action of plant sterols when provided in a fishoil fatty acids vehicle remains to be investigated in humans a randomized crossoverfeeding singleblind trial was conducted in 30 subjects with mildtomode rate hypercholesterolemia to study the effects on plasma lipids of 2 novel forms of plant sterols those combined with or esterified to fishoil fatty acids the treatments were margarine control free plant sterols plant sterols esterified to fatty acids from sunflower oil plant sterols esterified to very longchained fatty acids from fish oil and plant sterols combined with the same amount of very longchained fatty acids from fish oil each sterolcontaining food 1018 g plantsterolsd was consumed for 29 das a single dose with breakfast under staff supervision compared with the control treatment none of the plant sterol preparations reduced plasma total cholesterol or ldl cholesterol triacylglycerol apolipoprotein ai apolipoprotein b lipoprotein a or creactive protein concentration relative to the control phase all plant sterols treatment increased the plasma hdl cholesterol concentration p  005 by similar to 8 in conclusion because standard forms of plant sterols did not reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations the efficacy of the new formulation of plant sterols cannot be confirmed from the present study design where plant sterols were given as a single morning dose
trans fatty acids can be found in ruminant fats in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and in heattreated vegetable oils following some data on the worldwide consumption of trans fatty acids this paper reviews the studies carried out on the metabolic effects of trans fatty acids since trans fatty acids were shown to interfere with the metabolism of essential fatty acids and the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid their physiological effects on platelet aggregation lipoprotein metabolism and neuronal function are discussed
trans fatty acids tfa contents were analyzed in 26 food items that were collected from korean grocery stores in 2005 and 2008 lipid was extracted through soxhlet and mojonnier methods fatty acid profile including tfa and positional fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography the comparative study of fatty acids composition including tfa was employed in 2005 and 2008 among the analyzed food items most of the food items showed higher lipid content in 2005 than in 2008 some food items such as biscuits 0472 g100 g of food fried snacks 0136 g100 g of food and cookies 0424 g100 g of food contained relatively higher level of tfa than other food groups cracker processed chocolate and ice cream in 2005 comparing tfa content in 2005 it was considerably decreased up to 915 in 2008 whereas saturated fatty acids sfa were increased up to 433 in the analyzed food items
objective the effects of trans9 18 1 octadecenoic acid isomer from the fatty acid isomers taken with diet on soluble cell adhesion molecules sicam1 soluble intercellular adhesion molecule1 and svcam1 soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule1 and insulin like growth factor1 igf1 levels were investigated on rats method the rats which were fed for two weeks by the same diet were separated into experimental and control groups fifty mgday trans9 18 1 octadecenoic acid isomer was added to the diet of experimental group for 10 days following the completion of special diet fatty acid composition in both groups was studied by gas chromatography analysis results trans9 18 1 fatty acid level in the experimental group was higher than control group p001 the soluble cell adhesion molecules sicam1 and svcam1 increased p001 and igf1 levels decreased p005 in rats fed with trans9 18 1 octadecenoic acid conclusion our results indicate that high levels of dietary trans fatty acid isomers are a factor in the increasing of cell adhesion molecules sicam1 svcam1 levels and decreasing of igf1 levels hence measurement of these parameters may be beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis as well as in other pathological cases we believe that these parameters may also be useful for early diagnosis
the objectives of the current study that is the first of its kind were to determine the prevalence of the hypertriglyceridemic waist hw phenotype in a nationally representative sample of children as well as the metabolic risk factors identified by hw and to identify lifestyle habits related to this phenotype this national survey was conducted on 4811 representative schoolstudents we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the hw phenotype for abnormal anthropometric and biochemical factors by using receiver operator characteristic curves we determined the association of dietary patterns obtained by factor analysis physical activity level and some environmental factors with the hw phenotype overall 852 of participants had the hw phenotype those children with the hw phenotype were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors notably for overweight and hypercholesterolemia the dietary pattern characterized by junk foods increased the odds of having the hw phenotype or  1426 95 ci 1109 1892 whereas the other dietary pattern including healthy foods decreased this odds or  0874 95 ci 0765 0998 the risk of the hw phenotype rose with the consumption of solid hydrogenated fat as well as whiteflour bread low education of parents and a positive family history of diabetes mellitus obesity and or premature cardiovascular disease were the other risk factors for the hw phenotype low levels of physical activity significantly increased the risk of having the hw phenotype the hw phenotype can be used as an accurate and easy tool for screening children at metabolic risk in populationbased studies
introduction as a consequence of the scientific evidence which show that the high consumption of trans fatty acids is a risk factor of certain illnesses sanitary authorities recommend less than 1 intake of trans fatty acids of the total energy intake moreover the european commission must present by december 2014 a report about the presence of trans fatty acids in the aliments as well as in the diet of the european union population thus this study can provide useful information to reach this objective objectives to determine trans fatty acid presence in some types of foods in the community of madrid methods 170 samples of different foods commonly consumed by children and adolescents were selected and analized all foods had been purchased in big shopping centers in the community of madrid during february of 2010 results are shown as the percentage of each fatty acid compared to the total amount of fat in the aliment results only 33 products 194 showed the presence of trans fatty acids over the method detection limit  01g per 100g the highest levels were found in dairy products with an average content of 04 discusionconclusiones the trans fatty acid content of the analyzed foods can be considered low compared with the amount reported by other authors in food products marketed in spain and other countries in the past few years further studies should be undertaken to control nutrition security and diet quality of fat intake in the spanish population particularly among children and adolescents
cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in recipients of renal transplants although the risk for cardiovascular disease is in part genetically determined it may also be influenced by diet the aim of the present study was to analyze the crosssectional association of dietary intake of nutrients with biochemical markers of atherogenic risk the influence of diet on the plasma profile of fatty acids was specifically investigated twentynine children and adolescents mean age 14 years range 618 years with stable renal transplants and on a normal diet recorded their food intake for a period of 3 days the mean calorie intake was 406 kcalkg per day protein provided 16 of total calories carbohydrates 45 and fat 39 plasma levels of total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol were significantly and positively related to intake of monounsaturated fatty acids  r 066 p 0007 and r 062 p 002 respectively and to plasma levels of elaidic acid a trans fatty acid  r 043 p 002 and r 054 p 001 respectively insulin resistance estimated from values of plasma glucose  r 070 p 003 plasma insulin  r 059 p 002 and homa index  r 062 p 001 was also directly related to the intake of monounsaturated fatty acids plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor1 activity correlated positively with total fat intake  r 059 p 004 plasma levels of homocysteine were negatively related to the intake of carbohydrates  r 062 p 002 we conclude that reasonable dietary recommendations to minimize the atherogenic risk in children with stable renal transplants should include a protein intake adjusted to the requirements for age a large intake of carbohydrates leading to a low glycemic load and a fat intake of less than 30 of the total calorie intake the amount of monounsaturated and trans fatty acids in the diet should be especially limited a sufficient intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids with an adequate ratio between omega6 and omega3 components should also be provided

trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated vegetable and fish oils increase ldlcholesterol and decrease hdlcholesterol serum concentration when consumed in large amounts recent multicenter studies from europe indicate that the average intake of trans fatty acids is reasonably low and represents between 05 and 20 of the caloric intake in these amounts trans fatty acids do not appear to have an affect on the risk of coronary heart disease a considerably higher intake of trans fatty acids may be associated with a moderately increased risk of chd as suggested by a prospective cohort study from finland trans fatty acids from animal fats comprise 35 to 70 of trans fatty acid intake in europe their effects have not been studied separately but it is known that the metabolism of the main trans isomer of animal fat lit vaccenic acid differs from the main isomers of partially hydrogenated vegetable and fish oils in mediterranean countries the consumption of both saturated and trans fatty acids is moderate and the risk of chd is low however in central and northern european countries the consumption of saturated fatty acids is tenfold 12 to 18 compared with that of trans fatty acids 1 to 2 further benefits can be achieved by reducing the consumption of foods high in c1216 saturated fatty acids instead of focussing on trans fatty acids alone c1998 medikal press

intake of transunsaturated fatty acids tfa has been consistently shown in multiple and rigorous randomized trials to have adverse effects on blood lipids most notably on the ldlhdl cholesterol ratio which is a strong marker of cardiovascular risk when a mixture of tfa isomers obtained by partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils is used to replace oleic acid there is a dosedependent increase in the ldlhdl ratio the relationship between amount of tfa as  of energy and the increase in the ldlhdl ratio appears to be approximately linear with no evidence of a threshold at low levels of intake and with slope twice as steep as that observed by replacing oleic with saturated fats the average impact of tfa induced changes in the ldlhdl ratio correspond to tens of thousands premature deaths in the us alone although dramatic this effect is substantially smaller than the increase in cardiovascular mortality associated with tfa intake in epidemiological studies suggesting that other mechanisms are likely to contribute to the toxicity of tfa c 2006 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
background concern that transfatty acids formed in the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils may increase the risk of coronary disease has existed for several decades but direct evidence on this relation in humans is limited methods and results with a casecontrol design we studied the association between intake of transfatty acids and a first acute myocardial infarction among 239 patients admitted to one of six hospitals in the boston area and 282 population control subjects intake of transfatty acids was estimated using a previously validated food frequency questionnaire after adjustment for age sex and energy intake intake of transfatty acids was directly related to risk of myocardial infarction relative risk for highest compared with lowest quintile 244 95 confidence interval 142 419 for trend p0001 this relation remained highly significant after adjustment for established coronary risk factors multivitamin use and intake of saturated fat monounsaturated fat linoleic acid dietary cholesterol vitamins e and c carotene and fiber intake of margarinethe major source of transisomerswas significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction conclusions these data support the hypothesis that intake of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils may contribute to the risk of myocardial infarction

trans fatty acids are formed during the process of partial hydrogenation in which liquid vegetable oils are converted to margarine and vegetable shortening concern has existed that this process may have adverse consequences because natural essential fatty acids are destroyed and the new artificial isomers are structurally similar to saturated fats lack the essential metabolic activity of the parent compounds and inhibit the enzymatic desaturation of linoleic and linolenic acid in the past 5 y a series of metabolic studies has provided unequivocal evidence that trans fatty acids increase plasma concentrations of lowdensitylipoprotein cholesterol and reduce concentrations of highdensitylipoprotein hdl cholesterol relative to the parent natural fat in these same studies trans fatty acids increased the plasma ratio of total to hdl cholesterol nearly twofold compared with saturated fats on the basis of these metabolic effects and the known relation of blood lipid concentrations to risk of coronary artery disease we estimate conservatively that 30 000 premature deathsy in the united states are attributable to consumption of trans fatty acids epidemiologic studies although not conclusive on their own are consistent with adverse effects of this magnitude or even larger because there are no known nutritional benefits of trans fatty acids and clear adverse metabolic consequences exist prudent public policy would dictate that their consumption be minimized and that information on the trans fatty acid content of foods be available to consumers
although the disadvantages of trans fatty acids tfas are widely mentioned limited data are available on the tfas contents of iranian foods including fast foods the aim of this study was to quantify the amounts of common fatty acids in several fast foods in iran with specific focus on tfas the most commonly consumed fast foods in iran sausage calbas hamburgers and pizzas were randomly selected seven times from products available in supermarkets and restaurants each time a 10 g sample was drawn and prepared for fatty acid analysis total and individual fatty acids were quantified according to standard methods by gas chromatography with 60 meter capillary column and flame ionization detector the most common saturated fatty acids in iranian fast foods is stearic acid c180 which ranged from 140 to 209 saturated fatty acid content in calbas was significantly higher than that found in other groups trans fatty acids constitute almost 236 to 306 of total fatty acids of these products the most common tfa in these fast foods was elaidic acid c181 9t total cis unsaturated fatty acid content of tested fast foods varied from 253  in sausage to 468in calbas with oleic acid c181 9c followed by linoleic acid c182 being the most common fatty acids in these products this study showed higher tfas contents in commercially available fast foods compared to the amounts recommended by dietary guidelines in iran further studies must assess the effects of these fatty acids on human health

epidemiological evidence has associated dietary trans fatty acids tfa with heart disease tfa are primarily from hydrogenated fats rich in elaidic acid but dairy products also contain naturally occurring tfa such as vaccenic acid our purpose in this study was to compare the effects of consuming a commercially hydrogenated vegetable shortening rich in elaidic tfa 181t9 or a butter rich in vaccenic tfa 181t11 in the absence and presence of dietary cholesterol on atherosclerosis ldl receptor deficient ldlr mice were fed 1 of 8 experimental diets for 14 wk with the fat content replaced by regular porksoy fat rg elaidic shortening es regular butter rb vaccenic butter vb or an atherogenic diet containing 2 cholesterol with rg chrg es ches rb chrb or vb chvb serum cholesterol levels were elevated with cholesterol feeding p  0001 whereas serum triglyceride levels were higher only in the chrb p  0001 and chvb p  0001 groups compared with the other 6 groups serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the chvb group than in the chrb group p  0001 atherosclerosis was stimulated by dietary es compared with rg p  0021 but ches did not stimulate atherosclerosis beyond chrg alone in contrast vb did not induce an increase in atherosclerotic plaque formation compared with the rg and rb diets and the chvb diet reduced atherosclerosis compared with the other diets containing cholesterol p  001 in summary consuming a hydrogenated elaidic acidrich diet stimulates atherosclerosis whereas a vaccenic acidrich butter protects against atherosclerosis in this animal model j nutr 140 1824 2010
animal studies suggest that oxyphytosterols are atherogenic however we have previously shown that plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations did not increase after consuming a diet enriched in plant sterol esters 3 gday while minor reductions were seen after consuming a plant stanol esterenriched diet large variations in oxyphytosterol concentrations between individuals however existed the aim of this study was to identify factors that may explain interindividual differences in plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations for this 43 subjects consumed for 4 weeks in random order a plant sterol stanol and control margarine plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations were determined in butylated hydroxytoluene bhtenriched edta plasma via gc ms and serum oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein oxldl concentrations were analyzed via elisa trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity teac values alphatocopherol concentrations and ironcopper status were determined to assess plasma oxidative and antioxidative capacity serum nonoxidized sitosterol and campesterol concentrations did not correlate with plasma oxysitosterol and oxycampesterol concentrations during any of the three dietary interventions moreover plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations remained relatively stable overtime six subjects could be arbitrarily classified as having consistent low or high plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations which was also reflected in oxldl concentrations however oxidative and antioxidative capacity markers such as ironcopper status alphatocopherol concentrations and teac values could not explain these differences in conclusion subjects seem to have consistent plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations which resulted in the identification of low and high oxidizers differences however could not be attributed to the oxidative and antioxidative capacity markers analyzed c 2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
background consumption of plant sterols and plant stanols reduces lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc concentrations at the same time plasma plant sterol concentrations will increase after plant sterol consumption but decrease after plant stanol consumption in contrast to plant stanols plant sterols can undergo oxidation and form oxyphytosterols findings from in vitro and animal studies suggest that oxyphytosterols might be atherogenic objective the objective was to examine whether plant sterol and stanol consumption changes fasting plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations design a randomized double blind crossover study was performed in which 43 healthy subjects 1870 years consumed for 4 weeks a plant sterolenriched 30 gd of plant sterols a plant stanolenriched 30 gd of plant stanols and a control margarine separated by washout periods of 4 weeks oxyphytosterol concentrations were determined in bhtenriched plasma via gcms results compared to control serum ldlc concentrations were reduced after plant sterol 81 p  0001 and plant stanol consumption 78 p  0001 plant sterol consumption did not change plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations on the other hand intake of the plant stanol margarine reduced 7 betaohcampesterol by 007 ngml similar to 14 p  001 and by 007 ngml similar to 15 p  001 compared with the control and sterol margarines respectively when standardized for serum cholesterol effects on these oxyphytosterols were comparable in addition plant stanol intake reduced cholesterolstandardized 7ketocampesterol levels compared with plant sterol intake p  005 conclusions daily consumption of a plant sterolenriched margarine does not increase oxyphytosterol concentrations while plant stanol consumption may reduce the concentrations of the oxidative plant sterol metabolites 7 betaohcampesterol and 7ketocampesterol this trial is registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct01559428 c 2013 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved

background biomarkers can provide a more accurate measure of longterm intake than can dietary questionnaires objective the objective was to identify which adipose tissue fatty acids are suitable biomarkers of intake as assessed with a validated foodfrequency questionnaire design costa rican men with a mean  sd age of 56  11 y n  367 and women aged 60  10 y n  136 completed a 135item foodfrequency questionnaire and provided art adipose tissue sample fifty fatty acids were identified by capillary gas chromatography correlation coefficients were calculated after adjustment for age sex body mass index and smoking status results the best adipose tissue marker for total intake of saturated fatty acids was 150  170 r  018 both 150 and 170 were also the best correlates of dairy product intake r  031 for each the dietadipose tissue correlations for n3 fatty acids were r  034 for 183 r  015 for 205 and r  018 for 226 fish intake correlated significantly with these adipose tissue n3 fatty acids dietary and adipose tissue n6 fatty acids were highly correlated 182 r  058 and 183 r  024 the best indicators of total trans fatty acid intake were ct182n6 and tc182n6 r  058 for each total 181 trans fatty acid r  045 and 16 1 trans fatty acid r  016 were the next best indicators conclusions adipose tissue is a suitable biomarker of dietary fatty acid intake particularly for n3 and n6 cis polyunsaturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids ideally adipose tissue and dietary questionnaires should complement rather than substitute for each other in epidemiologic studies
to further understand the fatty aciddisease relationships in an epidemiologic context detailed composition tables are required the composition of the major saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids that are most abundant in the diet is available for numerous foods in many countries but data on the content of individual fatty acids with relative low abundance are scarce we conducted a study to establish a fatty acid composition database that includes fatty acids with low relative abundance as well as trans fatty acids for the main sources of fat in the costa rican diet fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography we present indepth fatty acid composition tables for foods that are commonly used in costa rica these analyses include information on alphalinolenic gammalinolenic arachidonic acid and trans fatty acids which are important for health but where information is scarce of particular interest is the high content of trans fatty acids in partially hydrogenated soybean oil in costa rica although decreasing over time in a period of 10 years the amount of total trans fatty acids in costa rican soybean oil has decreased from an average of 20 to 15 while alphalinolenic has increased from an average of 187 to 606 our data will be of special interest for studies on latin american countries requiring dietary information c 2006 elsevier inc all rights reserved

hydrogenation of vegetable oils using stable catalysts with satisfactory activity and selectivity as well as very low trans fatty acid tfa and saturated fatty acid sfa production is a challenging task it is known that unhealthy tfa formation is the result of positional and conjugative isomerization sidereactions occurring during hydrogenation from this standpoint it is possible to formulate active selective and stable catalysts which would minimize the production of tfa and sfa monometallic pd and bimetallic pdme memo ni co ru and sr highly dispersed on mesostructured sbasilica material with pore size ranging from 6 to 7 nm betspecific surface of 800900 m2g and metal nominal total loading up to 10  ww were comparatively investigated as catalysts for lowering the unhealthy trans tfa and saturated sfa fatty acids and maximizing the highly healthbeneficial cismonoenes production during the hydrogenation of sunflower oil at 110 degrees c under hydrogen pressure of 5 atm the pdcatalyst at nominal metal loading of 08  supported on nanostructured support was active and selective for the hydrogenation of sunflower oil under mild process conditions it produced less saturated acid and reached a good selectivity towards monoenes in all cases the consecutive impregnations of pd and a second metal on the mesoporous silica support preserved the mesoporous structure of the support with slight modification of the textural characteristics in terms of bet surface area pore size distribution and total pore volume the addition of nominal 02  co sr or ru to 08 pdcatalyst enhanced its activity however the addition of nominal 02  ni or mo dropped the activity of monometallic pdcatalyst significantly it is clearly shown that ru had some promoting effect to inhibit further the formation of trans fatty acids the addition of a second metal to pdcatalyst had no significant effect on the formation of c180 high degree of metalmetal metalsupport as well as metaloil interactions would greatly influence the reaction mechanisms of the vegetable oil hydrogenation

a set of 46 different trademarks of margarines produced in brazil by eight different companies was investigated in terms of the national labeling requirements for marts fatty acids tfa experimental measurements of the content of total saturated fatty acids cismonounsaturated fatty acids cispolyunsaturated fatty acids and total tfa by gas chromatography showed the reliability of the data listed on the nutrition facts panel which were used as reference for this analysis the results revealed that 50 of the manufacturers and 13 of all the investigated trademarks of margarines violated the current brazilian labeling regulations a group of 200 consumers categorized by age sex and years of formal education was also questioned about the importance of nutrition labeling information and tfa approximately 33 of the consumers interviewed were not informed about the possible detrimental effects of tfa on human health individuals with longer years of formal education and those affected by coronary heart diseases attributed to the intake of tfa were most interested in reading the nutrition labeling
in many of the preparations instead of saturated fatty acids sfa trans fatty acid tfa produced by partial hydrogenation of unsaturated oils were advocated as the preferred fatty acid base for solid fats the present study was designed to investigate the effects of dietary fats rich in sfa and tfa on lipid profile and endogenous antioxidant enzymes in normal and stressed rats twenty eight day old male wistar rats were fed for duration of 45 days with fat enriched special diet 10 fat prepared with coconut oil co palm oil po sfa rich vanaspathi vp tfa rich and groundnut oil control respectively present study claims the protective role co against atherogenic index and lipid peroxidation under normal and stress conditions po though contains sfa possesses less beneficial effect than co but safer than vp in causing atherogenicity whereas vp by virtue of its hyperlipidemic and oxidative stress generating ability exhibits deleterious effects in causing atherogenicity hence the consumption of high content of tfas may aggravate the occurrence of cardiovascular disease this effect being worse when accompanied with stress

trans fatty acids arise from hydrogenation in vivo and in vitro estimates of dietary intake of trans acids are available from a few countries and show an enormous variation from one population group to another and even within one food type the impact of trans fatty acid consumption on cell membrane composition growth and development risk of cardiovascular disease and occurrence of cancer is not clear published data have several inconsistencies and are open to different interpretation given the complexity of the situation it is prudent to avoid making sweeping recommendations until more specific data are available however large intakes of trans fatty acids should be avoided
background the process of randomization is used commercially to harden fats as an alternative to partial hydrogenation but its effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors are uncertain objective the objective was to compare the chronic and acute effects of randomization of a fat rich in 13distearyl 2oleyl glycerol on fasting and postprandial lipids glucose insulin and activated clotting factor vii fviia concentrations design a crossover design study in 16 men compared fasting and postprandial lipid glucose insulin and fviia concentrations at baseline and after a 3wk diet providing 30 g unrandomized or randomized shea butter and sunflower oil blends ssobs both of which contained approximate to 50 stearic acid fecal fat excretion was measured during each dietary period postprandial changes were assessed after the consumption of meals providing 50 g test fat a subsequent study compared postprandial changes after the consumption of an oleic acidrich sunflower oil meal and an unrandomized ssob meal results both ssobs were well digested and absorbed randomization did not affect fasting or postprandial lipid glucose insulin or fviia concentrations compared with the oleic acidrich meal the unrandomized ssob resulted in 53 lower postprandial lipemia 23 higher hepatic lipase activity and a 25 lower postprandial increase in fviia concentration the solid fat contents at 37 degrees c were 22 41 and 0 with the unrandomized ssob randomized ssob and oleic acidrich meals respectively conclusions stearic acidrich triacylglycerol in both unrandomized and randomized forms does not adversely affect lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease the high proportion of solid fat at 37 degrees c may explain the decreased postprandial lipemic response
background average salt intake in south african sa adults 81 gday is higher than the 4  6 gday recommended by the world health organization much salt consumption arises from nondiscretionary intake the highest proportion from bread with contributions from margarine soup mixes and gravies this contributes to an increasing burden of hypertension and cardiovascular disease cvd objectives to provide saspecific information on the number of fatal cvd events stroke ischaemic heart disease and hypertensive heart disease and nonfatal strokes that would be prevented each year following a reduction in the sodium content of bread soup mix seasoning and margarine methods based on the potential sodium reduction in selected products we calculated the expected change in populationlevel systolic blood pressure sbp and mortality due to cvd and stroke results proposed reductions would decrease the average salt intake by 085 gpersonday this would result in 7 400 fewer cvd deaths and 4 300 less nonfatal strokes per year compared with 2008 cost savings of up to r300 million would also occur conclusion populationwide strategies have great potential to achieve public health gains as they do not rely on individual behaviour or a wellfunctioning health system this is the first study to show the potential effect of a salt reduction policy on health in sa

soybean glycine max l merr oil typically contains about 7 of linolenic acid an oxidatively unstable fatty acid that is undesirable for many food applications for cooking oil reduction of the linolenic acid content by partial hydrogenation produces trans fatty acids which are now known to increase the risk of coronary heart disease genetic reduction of linolenic acid was achieved decades ago and recently the molecular genetic basis for both 3 and 1 linolenic acid soybean germplasm was revealed to be combinations of mutations in three independent members of the soybean omega3 fatty acid desaturase fad3 genes that corresponded to the fan1 fan2 and fan3 loci when the mutant gmfad3a and gmfad3c genes are found in combination in the breeding line cx151244 the linolenic acid content is reduced to approximately 3 of the of the seed oil when the mutant gmfad3a and gmfad3b genes are in combination in the breeding line rg10 a similar fatty acid profile is produced with approximately 3 linolenic acid the objective of this work was to determine the ability of different combinations of mutant fad3 alleles from cx151244 and an rg10derived soybean line to produce less than 3 linolenic acid in the seed oil the results indicated that novel combinations of mutations in the three fad3 genes are capable of producing soybean seeds containing only 1 linolenic acid in the seed oil
black p n and s sharpe 1997 dietary fat and asthma is there a connection european respiratory journal 101 612
the last two decades have seen an increase in the prevalence of asthma eczema and allergic rhinitis in developed countries this increase has been paralleled by a fall in the consumption of saturated fat and an increase in the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet this is due to a reduction in the consumption of animal fat and an increase in the use of margarine and vegetable oils containing od polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas such as linoleic acid there is also evidence for a decrease in the consumption of oily fish which contain omega3 pufas such as eicosapentaenoic acid in a number of countries there are social class and regional differences in the prevalence of allergic disease which are associated with differences in the consumption of pufas linoleic acid is a precursor of arachidonic acid which can be converted to prostaglandin e2 pge2 whereas eicosapentaenoic acid inhibits the formation of pge2 pge2 acts on tlymphocytes to reduce the formation of interferongamma ifngamma without affecting the formation of interleukin4 il4 this may lead to the development of allergic sensitization since il4 promotes the synthesis of immunoglobulin e ige whereas ifngamma has the opposite effect changes in the diet may explain the increase in the prevalence of asthma eczema and allergic rhinitis the effects of diet may be mediated through an increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin e2 which in turn can promote the formation of immunoglobulin e cers journals ltd 1997

the incorporation of fat in diets for heavy pigs may be necessary in order to increase their energy intake in the finishing period lard may be a good lipid source but it contains 1013 of linoleic acid which makes the subcutaneous fat less suitable for long term curing of raw ham partial hydrogenation of lard decreases linoleic acid content but increases transfatty acid content this trial involved two groups of pigs of 114 kg live weight fed for the last two months before slaughter with diets containing 3 lard l or 3 partially hydrogenated lard phl the phl contained about 10 transfatty acids and 25 linoleic acid rearing performance and carcass characteristics were unaffected by treatment the group fed phl showed a lower percentage of linoleic acid in the backfat phl 1228 vs l 1304 and a higher percentage of c181 transfatty acids both in backfat 05 vs 006 and in intramuscular fat 02 vs 004 c 2005 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the food sources for the macronutrients and the antioxidant vitamins in the diets of nonmanual and manual occupational groups were assessed nearly 10000 men and women aged 4059 years completed food frequency questionnaires as part of a study of risk factors for coronary heart disease the scottish heart health study twentyfive food groups are identified and their percentage contribution to each of the nutrients are reported clear differences in the nutrient sources occur between both the sexes and the social class groups quantitatively the top four food items for men are alcoholic drinks milk potatoes and bread and for women are milk bread fresh fruit and potatoes meat products as distinct from carcass meat and hard margarines are responsible for most of the differences in total fat and saturated fat intake between the social class groups key differences occur in the percentage of vitamin c and fibre from fruit juice fresh fruit green vegetables and potatoes the importance of carrots to carotene intake varies by social class and in the manual groups a greater percentage of vitamin e is derived from eggs and hard margarine than from soft margarine and vegetable oils these data complement the findings that nutrient intakes differ between social class groups by highlighting the foods which bring this about the information is relevant to dietitians and health educators who may wish to bring about dietary change in populations
reports of the effects of trans fatty acids on coronary heart disease are inconsistent trans fatty acids may particularly influence coronary risk when linoleic acid levels are low a situation which occurs in scotland where prevalence of coronary heart disease is also very high the link between trans fatty acid intake and prevalent coronary heart disease was therefore investigated in the scottish heart health study population trans fatty acid intakes were calculated from 10359 sets of foodfrequency questionnaire data obtained from the crosssectional survey of men and women aged 4059 years logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratios for prevalent coronary heart disease by fifths of dietary intake of total natural and commercial hydrogenationderived trans fatty acid the group who had undiagnosed coronary heart disease at the time of survey was the pertinent group for examining the possible causative effects of trans fatty acid intake after adjustment for the confounding factors ie age weight height smoking level of physical activity blood pressure total energy intake and intakes of saturated fat linoleic acid and the antioxidant vitamins the odds of undiagnosed coronary heart disease for menrelative to the lowest intake fifth did not differ significantly from unity by total or commercially derived trans fatty acid intake odds were around 35 smaller in the higher intake fifths of naturallyderived trans fatty acids for women the odds of undiagnosed coronary heart disease tended to be greater in the higher fifths of total odds ratio 136 95 confidence interval 094 189 and hydrogenated 126 092 172 trans fatty acid relative to the lowest fifth but only reached significance in the third fifth of total trans fatty acid 136 101 183 dietary total and commerciallyderived trans fatty acids failed to influence the odds of coronary heart disease for men even though a significant increase in the ratio of low density plus very low density lipoprotein to high density lipoproteincholesterol occurred with trans fatty acid intake the results therefore do not support a major effect of dietary trans fatty acid from commercial hydrogenation on coronary heart disease risk in these scottish men the results for women are less clear and the possibility remains that individuals at the high extreme of trans fatty acid intake who may be essential fatty acid deficient are at enhanced risk of coronary heart disease
trans fatty acids produced during hardening of oils have been associated with higher cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart disease the potential risk from trans fatty acids may be greater in populations with relatively low intakes of essential fatty acids such as the scots who also have a high prevalence of heart disease means and ranges of trans fatty acid intakes are reported here for a scottish population a semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnaire was used to survey the diet of 10359 scottish men and women aged 4059 years in 19846 as part of the baseline scottish heart health study trans fatty acid levels were calculated for each food item on the questionnaire and the total subdivided into that which is derived naturally primarily by bacterial fermentation in ruminants and that which is produced during industrial hydrogenation hardening of vegetable and fish oils means and ranges of intakes of each trans fatty acid variable were calculated by sex age smoking and social class groups mean total trans fatty acid intakes for men were 71 sd 31 gd 27 sd 29 energy and for women were 64 sd 29 gd 33 sd 30 energy industrially hydrogenated trans fatty acids made up nearly 58 of the total intake for men and 61 for women with about 60 coming from cakes biscuits and sweets and 20 coming from the cheaper hard margarines the main sources of the naturally derived trans fatty acids were red meat 27 milk 20 butter 1819 and cheese 1316 differences between age smoking and social class groups were apparent however apart from the social class differences of up to 1 gd these were so small that they are unlikely to be of any biological significance unless compounded by other factors such as marginal essential fatty acid adequacy the possibility of trans fatty acid intakes up to 48 gd and 12 total energy compared with the department of health 1991 recommendations of 5 gd or 2 energy highlights the need for careful monitoring of the health risks at these high levels of intake

background and aim the recent interest in the development of evidencebased nutrition recommendations has resulted in the development of frameworks which enable a more structured evaluation of the link between diet and chronic disease this paper examines the application of the frameworks produced by the scottish intercollegiate guidelines network sign and the world cancer research fund wcrf by using as a case study the association between trans unsaturated fatty acids tfas and coronary heart disease tfas arise during industrial hydrogenation of vegetable or fish fats and oils and the natural digestion process in ruminant animals data synthesis numerous studies have examined the effects of tfa intake on serum lipids and lipoproteins and the association between tfa consumption and cardiovascular disease metabolic studies and metaanalyses show a clear and consistent association between increasing tfa intakes and an adverse lipid profile evidence from casecontrol and prospective cohort studies examining the association between tfa intakes and coronary heart disease is more heterogeneous and there are limitations in several of the studies conclusion white the evidence is sufficient to suggest a probable positive association between tfas and coronary heart disease and thus to justify a firm recommendation for a reduction in dietary tfa intake the evaluation of the data underlines the difficulties in extrapolating the principles of evidencebased medicine to evidencebased nutrition furthermore there is a paucity of research into the effects of animalderived tfas in amounts typically consumed in a western diet and their association with adverse lipid profiles or cardiovascular outcomes c 2008 elsevier bv alt rights reserved

warfarin has been successfully used in the medical management of thromboembolic disease for nearly six decades it is widely assumed that a dietary vitamin kwarfarin interaction exists to avoid this potential interference with the efficacy of warfarin in stable anticoagulation patients typically receive instructions to consume a constant dietary intake of vitamin k while dark green vegetables are primary sources of dietary vitamin k these foods are not commonly consumed on a daily basis in the united states however there still exists dietary resistance to warfarin that is attributable to vitamin k based on food analysis studies on vitamin k it is now known that dietary vitamin k is found in certain plant oils and prepared foods containing these plant oils such as baked goods margarines and salad dressings the preparation of foods with vitamin krich oils may also contribute to a dietwarfarin interaction although this has yet to be confirmed in a clinical trial a doseresponse of vitamin k on the effect of warfarin anticoagulation has not yet been established however there are sufficient data to suggest that a constant dietary intake of vitamin k that meets current dietary recommendations of 6580 mu gday is the most acceptable practice for patients on warfarin therapy vitamin k composition data for commonly consumed foods are now available and may facilitate successful anticoagulation for patients being treated with warfarin

in a previous paper we predicted that health effects of dietary fats in humans would require half a century or more to be understood instead of the decade or so predicted during 1956 by an editorial in the lancet 1 it would seem that our prediction may have been optimistic since it has now been reported that trans unsaturated fatty acids present in high concentrations in margarines promote hypercholesterolemia in humans 2 consequently there has been a call for the reclassification of dietary fats upon the basis of their hypercholesterolemic properties 3 using the latter criterion therefore many margarine brands would be classified as coronary artery disease risk foods the primary adverse metabolic action of trans unsaturated fatty acids is the competitive inhibition of delta6desaturase the hepatic enzyme responsible for the initial metabolic desaturation of the essential fatty acids cis linoleic and cis alphalinolenic acid in addition to margarines many other common foods such as deepfried foods many convenience foods and bakery products contain relatively high levels of trans fatty acids therefore since it has become virtually impossible to avoid a consistent daily dietary intake of trans fatty acids it would appear that a precautionary preventative supplementation of the diet with supplements containing the direct metabolic products of delta6desaturation of the essential fatty acids would be prudent such supplements are readily available

oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to primary and secondary oxidation products compounds and amounts of these products vary depending on the oxidative conditions because these oxidation products have different absorption and biological effects we performed 2 different heating treatments on sunflower oil the first was heating the oil at 190 to 195 degrees c for 28 h ie very oxidized oil and the other was heating at 60 degrees c for 12 d ie peroxidized oil in the frame of this study we compared the fatty acid composition of a refined sunflower oil fresh oil peroxidized oil very oxidized oil and a mixture 11 of fresh and very oxidized oil ie oxidized oil oil fatty acid compositions were affected by the heating treatments in addition different fatty acid isomers were formed during heating at 190 to 195 degrees c and significant differences were found between their contents in the sunflower oils we also studied the effect of feeding broilers with these oils and zn and tocopherol supplements on the fatty acid composition of their raw dark meat various trans fatty acid isomers increased in dark meat from broilers fed oxidized and very oxidized oils in addition discriminant analysis showed that ditransconjugated linoleic acid content was able to distinguish dark chicken meat from chickens fed sunflower oils heated at 190 to 195 degrees c
the objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary trans fatty acids tfa on the risk of coronary heart disease chd development in 90 pregnant and 97 nonpregnant women who were recruited between 1996 and 1999 in the southwest of france the contents of tfa in total lipids cholesteryl esters ce and total phospholipids tpl of the womens plasma were determined using a combination of thin layer chromatography and capillary gasliquid chromatography results indicate that the mean content of total tfa in plasma total lipids expressed as proportion of all fatty acids was 07 with trans 181 being the most prevalent isomers 67 followed by trans 182 25 and trans 161 8 trans 183 isomers were undetectable in tpl the tfa accounted for 07 of total fatty acids whereas in ce the mean tfa level was twice 03 as lower than in tpl moreover these tfa were mainly represented by trans 181 isomers in tpl and by trans 182 isomers in ce furthermore there was no evidence of significant correlations between concentrations of lowdensitylipoprotein ldl or highdensitylipoprotein hdl cholesterol and the tfa percentage in either adipose tissue or plasma overall based on these results it appears that the tfa intake level of french population does not induce an increase of chd risk

soybean glycine max l merr lines with the transgenic event dp3054231 produce a higholeate oil and those with the fan1c1640 and fan3rg10 alleles produce a lowlinolenate oil the objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic and seed traits of higholeate and lowlinolenate holl lines higholeate and normallinolenate honl lines and normaloleate and normallinolenate nonl lines selected from four singlecross populations segregating for the three genes a minimum of 14 f35 lines of each class in the four populations were evaluated in five environments during 2009 the mean fatty ester concentrations averaged across populations were 786 g kg1 oleate and 24 g kg1 linolenate for the holl lines 784 g kg1 oleate and 56 g kg1 linolenate for the honl lines and 226 g kg1 oleate and 75 g kg1 linolenate for the nonl lines the mean yield of the nonl lines was significantly greater than the holl lines by 45 and the honl lines by 30 of the 10 highest yielding lines in each population 60 were nonl 25 holl and 15 honl which indicated that it would be possible to select cultivars of both classes that yield as well as nonl cultivars the overlap among the three classes in the distributions of lines for protein oil seed weight maturity height and lodging indicated that it would be possible to develop holl and honl cultivars comparable to nonl cultivars for those traits
objective we have examined the role of dietary patterns and specific dietary nutrients in the etiology of lung cancer among nonsmokers using a multicenter casecontrol study methods 506 nonsmoking incident lung cancer cases were identified in the eight centers along with 1045 nonsmoking controls dietary habits were assessed using a quantitative foodfrequency questionnaire administered by personal interview based on this information measures of total carotenoids betacarotene and retinol nutrient intake were estimated results protective effects against lung cancer were observed for high consumption of tomatoes odds ratio or  05 95 confidence interval ci 0406 lettuce or  06 95 ci 0312 carrots or  08 95 ci 0511 margarine or  07 95 ci 0508 and cheese or  07 95 ci 0510 only weak protective effects were observed for high consumption of all carotenoids or  08 95 ci 0610 betacarotene or  08 95 ci 0611 and retinol or  09 95 ci 0711 protective effects for high levels of fruit consumption were restricted to squamous cell carcinoma or  07 95 ci 0412 and small cell carcinoma or  07 95 ci 0412 and were not apparent for adenocarcinoma or  09 95 ci 0613 similarly any excess risk associated with meat butter and egg consumption was restricted to squamous and small cell carcinomas but was not detected for adenocarcinomas conclusions this evidence suggests that the public health significance of increasing vegetable consumption among the bottom third of the population would include a reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among lifetime nonsmokers by at least 25 and possibly more a similar protective effect for increased fruit consumption may be present for squamous cell and small cell lung carcinomas
conjugated linoleic acids cla are of great interest for analysts since techniques have been developed to determine the dietary occurrence of cla with a good accuracy cla is found in animal products from ruminant sources as the result of biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the rumen and as the consequence of the delta9 desaturation of vaccenic acid in animal tissues cla can also be obtained in the laboratory by isomerisation of linoleic acid or by total chemical synthesis while the natural isomer is rumenic acid 9c11t182 synthetic mixtures contain mainly two isomers the 9c11t and the 10t12c182 although cla have been shown to be metabolized into desaturated and chain elongated products it remains unclear whether these soformed conjugated metabolites may be involved in the effects of cla on fatty acid metabolism experiments carried out on animal models with cla have shown different health benefits anticarcinogenic antiatherosclerotic effects modulation of body composition the natural cla 9c11t182 being closely related to the protection against cancer and the 10t 12c 182 to the reduction of the fat mass nevertheless recent findings have suggested adverse effects in mice most of the studies carried out on humans concern the influence of cla on body composition and its possible inverse association with cancer since the results are still controversial and since very few data dealing with the safety of using cla in long term feeding studies have so far been published further works are warranted to consider the benefits of cla for humans
increasing the knowledge on dietary fat composition mainly the minor components will improve the nutritional value of foods and their labeling in this study we examined the transoctadecenoic acid c181 composition of emmental cheeses enriched in unsaturated fatty acids fa and manufactured with milks produced by cows selected to produce small and large fat globules the fa composition of the milks was not significantly p  005 different from the fa composition of the corresponding emmental cheeses increasing the unsaturated fa content of the cheeses using dietary manipulations lead to an increase in the transc181 and changed their isomeric profiles in milk fat produced with the linseedenriched diet the trans10 c181 concentration was greater than trans11 c181 vaccenic acid which is classically the major transc181 in milk fat the content in transc181 and more particularly in trans10 c181 was negatively correlated with the size of fat globules r2  0 82 and 087 respectively and related to milk fat depression the transc181 content was negatively correlated with the saturated fa slope  035 r2  081 and positively correlated with the unsaturated slope  029 r2  085 and monounsaturated slope  032 r2  081 fa focusing on the healthrelated considerations of fat in food products further nutritional studies are needed to elucidate the role of transc181 isomers

background trans fatty acids are produced either by industrial hydrogenation or by biohydrogenation in the rumens of cows and sheep industrial trans fatty acids lower hdl cholesterol raise ldl cholesterol and increase the risk of coronary heart disease the effects of conjugated linoleic acid and trans fatty acids from ruminant animals are less clear we reviewed the literature estimated the effects trans fatty acids from ruminant sources and of conjugated trans linoleic acid cla on blood lipoproteins and compared these with industrial trans fatty acids methodologyprincipal findings we searched medline and scanned reference lists for intervention trials that reported effects of industrial trans fatty acids ruminant trans fatty acids or conjugated linoleic acid on ldl and hdl cholesterol in humans the 39 studies that met our criteria provided results of 29 treatments with industrial trans fatty acids 6 with ruminant trans fatty acids and 17 with cla control treatments differed between studies to enable comparison between studies we recalculated for each study what the effect of trans fatty acids on lipoprotein would be if they isocalorically replaced cis mono unsaturated fatty acids in linear regression analysis the plasma ldl to hdl cholesterol ratio increased by 0055 95 ci 00440066 for each  of dietary energy from industrial trans fatty acids replacing cis monounsaturated fatty acids the increase in the ldl to hdl ratio for each  of energy was 0038 95 ci 00120065 for ruminant trans fatty acids and 0043 95 ci 00120074 for conjugated linoleic acid p  099 for difference between cla and industrial trans fatty acids p  037 for ruminant versus industrial trans fatty acids conclusionssignificance published data suggest that all fatty acids with a double bond in the trans configuration raise the ratio of plasma ldl to hdl cholesterol
this review asks the question if further research on trans fatty acids and cardiovascular health is needed we therefore review the evidence from human studies on trans fatty acids and cardiovascular health and provide a quantitative review of effects of trans fatty acid intake on lipoproteins the results show that the effect of industrially produced trans fatty acids on heart health seen in observational studies is larger than predicted from changes in lipoprotein concentrations there is debate on the effect of ruminant trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease of special interest is conjugated linoleic acid cla which is produced industrially for sale as supplements observational studies do not show higher risks of cardiovascular disease with higher intakes of ruminant trans fatty acids however cla industrial and ruminant trans fatty acids all raise plasma lowdensity lipoprotein and the total to highdensity lipoprotein ratio gram for gram all trans fatty acids have largely the same effect on blood lipoproteins in conclusion the detrimental effects of industrial trans fatty acids on heart health are beyond dispute the exact size of effect will remain hard to determine further research is warranted on the effects of ruminant trans fatty acids and cla on cardiovascular disease and its risk factors

cardiovascular complications are a leading cause of mortality worldwide and dietary patterns and lifestyle are key factors responsible for their progression sedentary lifestyle and transient changes in nutrition have led to drastic increases in such maladies during the last few decades and dietary changes are significant as they are coupled with high fat intake especially trans fats in developed countries legislations and monitoring systems have resulted in reduced consumption of these metabolites the developing world especially south asia is also facing the menace of trans fats lack of governmental interest and ignorance among consumers are the main reasons in these regions the use of hydrogenated vegetable oil ghee and shortening in deepfat frying of culinary items such as samosa paratha bhatura poori and tikkies results in increased consumption of trans fats research investigations and cohort studies showed a positive correlation between consumption of trans fats and cardiovascular disorders in this article trans fats intake and its level in different products available in developing countries particularly in south asia were reviewed along with information regarding processes involved in the production and possible reduction of trans fats

commercial trans fat tf is made from vegetable oil through partial hydrogenation tf can cause raised blood lipids leading to increased risk of coronary heart disease diabetes obesity cancer and infertility tf is commonly found in commercial products such as pies doughnuts fried chips cakes and biscuits examine food labels and avoid products with shortening vegetable fat and hydrogenated vegetable oil as these probably contain high tf content food manufacturers in australia are not yet required to state tf content on labels however some do if necessary only choose products with tf content 1
three surveys of the content of trans fatty acids tfa in foods on the danish market were carried out before and after the danish regulationvas introduced in january 2004 restricting the use of industrially produced iptfa to a maximum of 2 g per 100 g fat in any food product for this purpose food samples were collected in 20023 20045 and 20067 of these 60 paired samples defined as samples included in two of the three investigations and with higher levels of iptfa in the first determination than in the second were identified comparisons of the fatty acid profiles showed that in 68 of the products eg sweets cakes and cookies as well as fast food such as pie and tortilla iptfa were mainly substituted with saturated fatty acids sfa in some cases the sfa source was coconut fat whereas in other products palm oil was added instead of partially hydrogenated oils however in important cases like frying fats healthier fat substitutes with monounsaturated fatty acids were used the surveys showed that the iptfa content has been reduced or removed from most products with originally high iptfa content like french fries microwave oven popcorn and various bakery products so that iptfa are now insignificant for the intake of tfa in denmark

study objective  the aim was to compare nutrient intakes of smokers past smokers and nonsmokers design  the study was cross sectional and compared nutrient intake by smoking status using data obtained from a concurrent study of diet setting  the study took place in three towns in england ipswich wakefield and stoke on trent participants  food records were obtained from 1115 men and 1225 women aged 35 to 54 years representing response rates of 8486 in the three towns measurements and main results  diet was assessed using a 24h food record in household measures for both men and women vitamin c total fibre betacarotene and vitamin e intakes were lowest in the current smokers and highest in the nonsmokers with past smokers having intermediate values polyunsaturatedsaturated fat ratio was lowest in the current smokers men who smoked had higher energy intakes than those who did not the lower fat intakes of betacarotene vitamin c fibre and polyunsaturated fat in the smokers was due to fewer smokers eating a whole range of foods including fruit wholemeal bread cereals and polyunsaturated margarine current smokers had a lower body mass index than nonsmokers or past smokers despite their higher energy intakes conclusions  smokers have different nutrient and food intakes compared with past smokers or nonsmokers
plant sterols and stanols phytosterolsphytostanols are known to reduce serum lowdensity lipoprotein ldlcholesterol level and food products containing these plant compounds are widely used as a therapeutic dietary option to reduce plasma cholesterol and atherosclerotic risk the cholesterollowering action of phytosterolsphytostanols is thought to occur at least in part through competition with dietary and biliary cholesterol for intestinal absorption in mixed micelles however recent evidence suggests that phytosterolsphytostanols may regulate proteins implicated in cholesterol metabolism both in enterocytes and hepatocytes important advances in the understanding of intestinal sterol absorption have provided potential molecular targets of phytosterols an increased activity of atpbinding cassette transporter al abcal and abcg5g8 heterodimer has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the hypocholesterolaemic effect of phytosterols conclusive studies using abcal and abcg5g8deficient mice have demonstrated that the phytosteroltnediated inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption is independent of these atpbinding cassette abc transporters other reports have proposed a phytosterolphytostanol action on cholesterol esterification and lipoprotein assembly cholesterol synthesis and apolipoprotein apo b100containing lipoprotein removal the accumulation of phytosterols in abcg5g8deficient mice which develop features of human sitosterolaemia disrupts cholesterol homeostasis by affecting sterol regulatory elementbinding protein srebp2 processing and liver x receptor lxr regulatory pathways this article reviews the progress to date in studying these effects of phytosterolsphytostanols and the molecular mechanisms involved c 2008 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved

as a body of evidence suggests that dietary trans fatty acids raise blood cholesterol levels thereby increasing the risk of coronary heart disease on july 11 2003 fda issued a final rule requiring the mandatory declaration in the nutrition label of the amount of trans fat present in foods including dietary supplements the agency required that the declaration of trans fat be on a separate line immediately under the declaration for saturated fat since there was no scientific basis for establishing a dv for trans fat the final rule did not require the listing of a  dv as is required for some of the other mandatory nutrients such as saturated fat however a report from the world health organization who and the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations has recommended a very low intake of tfa less than 1 of daily energy intake therefore efforts have been made and are ongoing to decrease tfa in the food supply both in the us and globally there are many challenges that food manufacturers have faced during the development of new trans fat alternatives any replacement ingredient must provide the functional characteristics of the material being replaced in other words the alternative ingredient must provide the functionality of flakiness firmess of texture crispness or desired appearance in the finished product or it is likely to be rejected by the consumer the stability or shelf life of the finished product must also be maintained to ensure consumer acceptability in some applications like baked goods a certain amount of solids is crucial consumer concerns associated with the atherogenic effect of trans fatty acids limit the future of the hydrogenation process as a way of modifying the solidtoliquid ratio in vegetable oilsfats as an alternative to hydrogenated vegetable oils modification of high melting point stearins by blending with vegetable oils is becoming important since shortenings with appropriate physicochemical properties and good nutritional characteristics that are free of trans fatty acids and rich in pufa can be obtained thus it is of interest to discuss the potential of blends of a stearin such as a highmelting fraction of milk fat with a vegetable oil as trans fat replacer in this chapter the physical chemical properties of milk fatsunflower oil lowtrans blends that is crystallization behavior polymorphism microstructure and the effect of addition of emulsifiers in bulk systems will be reviewed
cantwell m m 2000 assessment of individual fatty acid intake proceedings of the nutrition society 592 187191
dietary assessment of individual fatty acid intake is difficult due to a number of limitations information regarding the type quantity and brandname of fat used in cooking and at the table is required in addition margarine manufacturers may change the component oils used for reasons of cost which changes the fatty acid composition of their products from seasontoseason independent markers of fatty acid intake are required therefore to compensate for these limitations adipose tissue concentrations have been used as a measure of habitual intake of fatty acid groups and individual fatty acids in numerous studies saturated sfa and monounsaturated fatty acids mufa are generally poorly correlated with adipose tissue concentrations which can be explained partly by endogenous synthesis in general adipose tissue concentrations of exogenouslyproduced fatty acids n3 and n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa are well correlated with estimates of habitual intake correlations between dietary trans unsaturated fatty acids tufa and adipose tissue concentrations vary between countries which may be due to differences in dietary sources correlations may be affected by differences in bioavailability or selective retention of fatty acids in certain tissue lipids
objective to assess fat intake with particular focus on trans unsaturated fatty acid tufa intake and the major sources of tufa among irish individuals using a fat intake questionnaire fiq designed specifically for an irish context subjects and methods a total of 105 healthy volunteers 43 females 62 males aged 2363 years were recruited from dublin airport medical centre republic of ireland dietary intake was assessed using an 88 food itemfood group semiquantitative fiq which was developed and validated for the irish population results mean energy intake was 106 mj day1 and 34 was provided by fat saturated monounsaturated polyunsaturated trans unsaturated fatty acids and linoleic acid contributed 13 10 6 2 and 5 of energy respectively mean tufa intake was 54 g day1 range 0326 margarine spreads provided the majority of tufas 193 g day1 but the contribution was significantly greater for men compared with women 235 g day1 versus 133 g day1 p  0024 milk and meat also contributed more to tufa intake for men compared with women but confectionery was a significantly greater contributor for women 86 versus 31 respectively p  001 conclusions although the mean tufa intake of the total group was 54 g day1 and was within current dietary recommendations 2 energy intake some individuals had intakes as high as 26 g day1 public health efforts are therefore required to reduce tufa intake in those individuals with high intakes

fatty acids containing trans unsaturated double bonds occur in nature but the most common dietary source are mantreated fats because of the possible link between transfatty acids transfa consumption and human disease mainly cardiovascular disease and cancer the health effects of transfa have been studied for over the last fifty years this study aims at assessing the intake of transfa and their distribution throughout the day and during the week in a young adult spanish population the average transfa intake was 255159 gday 229091 fat 085039 energy in men and 249184 gday 264125 fat 096048 energy in women breakfast 800 am approximately followed by dinner 1000 pm approximately showed the highest transfa densities g1000 kcal both in men and women higher not significant amounts of these fatty acids were found at the weekend rather than on weekdays average values in our study are lower than the upper limits established for european populations 2 energy and than data found in other countries however the high range of intakes observed 059 to 840 gday in men and 039 to 1280 gday in women makes it necessary for each case to be considered individually even though there is no evidence of risk at the low intake of transfa found in this study further research into this whole area is needed it is recommended that industry and individuals actively try to diminish the dietary transfatty acid levels in order to achieve an optimal diet so as to reduce the risk of chronic diseases
the term conjugated linoleic acid cla refers to a collection of positional and geometrical isomers of octaclecadienoic acid with conjugated double bonds cla has been shown to posses several beneficial activities in different experimental models however out of 28 isomers only two c9 t11 and t10 c12 have been thus far demonstrated to be biologically active the discovery that it can be elongated and desaturated as a regular fatty acid in human and animal tissues brought a new possibility that its activity may be related to its properties as a peculiar unsaturated fatty acid in fact cla is able to be incorporated in lipid classes as oleic acid accumulating in those tissues rich in neutral lipids to be metabolized as linoleic acid and so influencing linoleic acid desaturation and elongation and to be beta oxidized in peroxisomes which may account for through activation of ppars its ability to increase free retinol levels and influence gene expression these activities are amplified where cla accumulates more such as mammary and adipose tissues and may explain its peculiar beneficial properties at relative low dietary concentrations in these tissues furthermore it has been demonstrated that cla can be endogenously formed by delta 9 desaturation of vaccenic acid t11 181 thus forming the isomer c9 t11 either endogenously formed or through dietary intake cla showed to be metabolized in the same way and to exert the same biological properties we may conclude that a regular intake of cla orand vaccenic acid as its precursor should work as an excellent preventive agent by modulating lipid metabolism in target tissues thus conferring protection against the attack of insults of different type c 2002 elsevier science ltd all rights reserved

there are debates regarding trans fatty acids ffa while the tfa effects of industrial origin are well documented the impact of consumption of tfa of natural origin produced from ruminants remains little known
trans fatty acids fa enter all the metabolic pathways of bioconversion oxidation and lipid storage and are incorporated into all tissues they also interfere with the polyunsaturated fa metabolic pathways among trans fa major attention is paid to elaidic and vaccenic acids the latter is bioconverted into rumenic acid a conjugated linoleic acid cla isomer through the delta 9 desaturase pathway considering cla isomers they are also bioconverted by desaturases and the elongation pathway but the significance of this conversion is not fully understood this review considers these different aspects with particular attention to human data
the trans fatty acids present in our diet have two sources the first is natural from biodehydrogenation in ruminants and the second synthetic from partial dehydrogenation of fats and oils the major difference between the two types is the position of the double bonds on the carbon chain of the fatty acids several interventional studies have clearly shown that synthetic trans fatty acids have adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors increased ldlcholesterol and decreased hdlcholesterol these findings are supported by most epidemiological surveys however these deleterious effects have not been observed with the natural trans fatty acids the scarcity of epidemiological data would suggest a lack of effect but interventional trials are required to confirm this fact
background detrimental effects of consumption of industrial trans fatty acids tfa from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils phvo on cardiovascular disease cvd risk factors are well documented however very little information is available on the effect of natural sources of tfa coming from milk fat dairy products and ruminant meat in fact due to the naturally low level of tfa in milk fat it is almost impossible to conduct a clinical trial with a limited number of subjects  200 methodology to compare the effects of industrial and natural dietary sources of tfa two specific test fats have been designed and produced a substantial amount of milk fat 130 kg enriched in tfa has been produced by modification of the cows diet and selection of cows with the highest tfa content the level obtained was approximately 4 to 7fold higher than typically present in milk fat similar to 20 instead of 36 g100 g of total fatty acids the control fat is composed of phvo balanced in saturated fatty acids lauric myristic and palmitic both experimental fats contain about 2022 of monounsaturated tfa and the volunteers daily experimental fat intake 54 g will represent about 120 gday of tfa or 54 of the daily energy based on 2000 kcalday these two test fats have been incorporated into food items and will be provided to 46 healthy subjects under a randomised double blind controlled crossover design the primary outcome is highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc which is an independent risk factor for cvd other parameters such as lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc very lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol vldlc and hdlc level and subclasses will be also to be evaluated conclusion we have shown that it is technically feasible to perform a clinical trial on the comparative effects of natural and industrial sources of tfa isomers on cvd risk factors results are expected by mid2006 c 2006 elsevier inc all rights reserved
background previous studies suggest a positive association between markers of transfatty acid intake and prostate cancer we therefore prospectively evaluated the association between blood transfatty acid levels and risk of prostate cancer methods we conducted a nested casecontrol study among 14916 apparently healthy men who provided blood samples in 1982 blood fatty acid levels were determined for 476 men diagnosed with prostate cancer during a 13year followup and their matched controls controls were individually matched to cases according to age and smoking status at baseline conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk and 95 confidence interval of total nonaggressive stage ab and low grade and aggressive stage cd high grade subsequent distant metastasis or death prostate cancer associated with blood levels of specific transfatty acids results blood levels of all the transfatty acids examined were unrelated to total prostate cancer risk when results were divided according to tumor aggressiveness blood levels of 181n9t all the 182t examined and total transfatty acids were positively associated to nonaggressive tumors the relative risks 95 confidence intervals p trend comparing top with bottom quintile transfatty acid levels were 216 112417 011 for 181n9t 197 103375 001 for total 182t and 221 114429 006 for total transfatty acids none of the trans fats examined was associated with aggressive prostate tumors conclusion blood levels of trans isomers of oleic and linoleic acids are associated with an increased risk of nonaggressive prostate tumors as this type of tumors represents a large proportion of prostate cancer detected using prostatespecific antigen screening these findings may have implications for the prevention of prostate cancer

the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and more generally of metabolic syndrome goes with a well chosen diet however faced with a raft of often contradictory information many patients can become disorientated the role of the practitioner is to supply adapted personalised and scientifically consensual advice the consumption of certain types of foods naturally concentrated in protective elements should be favoured such as those rich in folates omega 3 fatty acids and potassium and low in sodium chloride furthermore some new foodstuffs are appearing which have been subjected to modifications in their composition enriched with certain nutrients or micronutrients low in sugar and certain fats thus for example margarines rich in phytosterols appear interesting despite limitations in their use similarly precautions of usage should accompany the consumption of products enriched with omega 3 sweeteners these attractive appearing and gustatively correct foods of the future will have more and more pronounced health claims but alimentary innovation relying on this basis in order to conquer new sections of the market risks causing new nutritional imbalances the practitioner must therefore remain sensible with nutritional advice and take account of economic and regional aspects by adapting it for each patient

to investigate the effect of dietary trans fatty acids on plasma and liver lipids 16 sprague dawley male rats fed the hydrogenated soybean oil trans fat or cis fat from olive oil with two similar dietary fatty acid ratios for 9 weeks were studied higher plasma total cholesterol and ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed in rats fed trans fat diet when compared with rats fed the cis fat diet after 2 weeks of feeding however no significant changes in plasma total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels were found in rats of both dietary groups at 4weeks of feeding rats fed trans fatty acids had lower plasma total cholesterol ldl and vldl very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at the end of the experimental period although significantly p 005 lower liver triacylglycerol contents were found in rats fed trans fat diet no significant p 005 changes in liver cholesterol and phospholipids contents were observed in rats after trans fatty acids treatment it is interesting that lower saturated to polyunsaturated ratios in fatty acid composition of plasma vldl total lipids were found in rats fed trans fat diet results from this study suggest that the changes in plasma lipoprotein cholesterol to the long or the short term study and dietary trans fatty acids may alter the plasma lipoprotein metabolism in rats
objectiveto examine the effect on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations when butter or an unsaturated margarine is used for cooking or spreading in a reduced fat diet designrandomised crossover study with two intervention periods of six weeks duration separated by a five week washout settingcommunity setting in new zealand subjects49 volunteers with polygenic hypercholesterolaemia and baseline total cholesterol concentration in the range 5579 mmoll main outcome measuresconcentrations of total and low density lipoprotein lpa lipoprotein high density lipoprotein apolipoprotein b 100 and apolipoprotein a i resultsconcentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein b were about 10 lower with margarine than with butter lpa lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were similar with the two diets conclusiondespite concerns about adverse effects on lipoproteins of trans fatty acids in margarines the use of unsaturated margarine rather than butter by hypercholesterolaemic people is associated with a lipoprotein profile that would be expected to reduce cardiovascular risk
to examine the effect on lipids and lipoproteins of the use of butter or an unsaturated margarine as the only cooking and spreading fat in a reduced fat diet we conducted a randomised crossover study with two intervention periods of six weeks duration separated by a five week washout forty nine volunteers with polygenic hypercholesterolaemia and baseline total cholesterol in the range 5579 mmoll took part total and low density lipoprotein lipoprotein a high density lipoprotein apolipoprotein b100 and apolipoprotein a1 were the main outcome measures low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein b levels were approximately ten  lower on margarine than on butter lipoproteina and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were similar on the two diets therefore the results indicate that when total fat is reduced to levels recommended for individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease the use of unsaturated margarine rather than butter by hypercholesterolaemic individuals is associated with a lipoprotein profile which would be expected to be associated with reduced cardiovascular risk

margarines transfatty acid composition modifications during the last decades and new trends trans fatty acids isomers are formed during the hydrogenation process used in the food industry to harden oils in the last decades there has been a great controversy about the consumption of margarine due to the levels of trans fatty acids they contain while in the eighties consumption of margarines was considered healthy during the nineties several studies indicated that consumption of 18 1 t increased ldlcholesterol levels and decreased hdlcholesterol level and was related with an increased risk of coronary heart disease the publicity about the unfavourable effects of trans fatty acid consumption seems to have influenced margarine producers to reduce the trans fatty acid content of margarines meanwhile usa has adopted a new legislation about trans fatty acid labelling in europe dinamarca has limited the maximum level of trans fatty acids allowed in food products
studies that have shown adverse effects of transunsaturated fatty acids on plasma lipoprotein a lpa levels have used levels of transfatty acid that are higher than those in the average us diet this study was conducted to clarify the effects on lpa of transfatty acids levels commonly found in us diets lpa levels were measured in a doubleblind study of 29 men and 29 women who ate 4 controlled diets in random order for 6 weeks each fatty acids represented 39 to 40 of energy the diets were 1 oleic 167 of energy as oleic acid 2 moderate trans 38 of energy as transmonoenes approximately the trans content of the us diet 3 high trans 66 of energy as transmonoenes 4 saturated 162 of energy as lauric plus myristic plus palmitic acids the saturated diet lowered lpa levels significantly by 8 to 11 compared to the oleic diet the trans diets had no adverse effect on lpa levels when all subjects were considered collectively a subset with initially high levels of lpa greater than or equal to 30 mgdl however responded to the high trans diet with a slight 5 increase in lpa levels relative to the oleic and moderate trans diets thus in amounts commonly found in the typical us diet saturated fatty acids consistently decrease lpa concentrations the adverse effects of replacing ciswith transfatty acids are only suggestive and are restricted to high trans intakes in subjects with high lpa levels
metabolic studies have clearly shown that trans fatty acids tfas elevate ldl and lower hdl cholesterol epidemiologic studies showed a relation between tfa intake and the risk of myocardial infarction mi but studies examining adipose tissue tfas have not uniformly confirmed this we performed a case control study examining both adipose tissue levels and dietary intake of tfas and first mi between 1995 and 1997 209 cases of first mi completed a 300item ffq and 79 had an adipose tissue biopsy 179 matched controls completed the ffq and 167 had a biopsy during the course of the study mid1996 tfas were eliminated from margarines sold in australia cases biopsied before mid1996 had greater levels of trans 181n9 32 p  003 and trans 181 n11 23 p  0001 than controls biopsied before mid1996 after june 1996 there were no differences between cases and controls in any of the adipose tissue tfas measured logistic regression showed that trans 181 n11 p  003 was an independent predictor of a first mi cases consumed 05 gd p  0002 more tfas than controls subjects in the highest quintile of tfa intake had an or for first mi of 21 95 ci 1143 which was not independent of saturated fat intake apparent tfa intake from margarine was related to adipose tissue 181tn9 and n10 in 1995 r  066 066 respectively we conclude that tfas in adipose tissue are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and rapidly disappear from adipose tissue when not included in margarines

mounting epidemiologic evidence worldwide has fostered policy regulation of industrially made trans fatty acids tfa in several developed countries despite countryspecific evidence about the effects of tfa on cardiovascular disease in costa rica policy regulation has yet to occur this qualitative study uses a conceptual framework to identify factors that may impede or promote the process of translation of scientific evidence about tfa into policy in the specific context of costa rica we used single casestudy methodology to integrate two sources of data review of relevant internal documents and indepth semistructured interviews with 21 respondents purposively sampled from three sectors the cooking oil and food industries research and academia and government entities content analysis guided by a conceptual framework of research utilization revealed 68 emergent themes divided across four categories of analysis in brief study participants perceived the political context suitable for discussing policies related to healthy fats nevertheless tfa regulation was not part of the costa rican political agenda barriers perceived by respondents that impede knowledge translation included 1 lack of awareness of incountry scientific studies on health effects of tfa 2 lack of consensus or information about policy options nutrition labelling dietary guidelines legislative mandates 3 perceived distrust and disparate attitudes between sectors believed by study participants to result in 4 limited collaboration across sectors commissioned task forces and other mechanisms to foster research engagement and facilitate sustained interaction and systematic collaboration among government food industry and researcher sectors appear crucial in the consideration and adoption of nutrition policy in costa rica and other emerging economies
this report addresses firstly the controversy about possible health hazards of dietary trans fatty acids tfa stemmed from many studies performed since the 90s dietary tfa ore supposed to increase the risk of coronary heart disease chd from the first data a positive relationship was found between the energy intake from 9t181 range 37 to 109 and ldlcholesterol concentrations this trans isomer in some cases can also lower hdlcholesterol concentrations epidemiological studies on associations between tfa intake and risk of chd are still not conclusive moreover methods of assessing tfa intake have certain weak points it would be desirable to combine dietary survey methods with biochemical indicators of long term fatty acid intake such as the adipose tissue results of a french study ore reported in the second part the aims of this study were to assess the tfa intake in aquitaine and to examine the relationship between the presence of tfa in adipose tissue and blood plasma and ldl and hdlcholesterol concentrations in plasma of nonpregnant n  97 and pregnant n  90 women through dietary 7days records the mean tfa consumption was 27 gdpers which represented 13 of energy intake the tfa level was 23  05 of total fatty acids in adipose tissue based on the 181 trans content of adipose tissue the population trans consumption was clearly lower than those of the other european countries usa and canada the composition of adipose tissue tfa was analyzed relative to the dietary sources of tfa ruminant fats and partially hydrogenated oils phvo the delta 11t 181 isomer was the most prevalent in adipose tissue like in ruminant fats estimates of relative contribution to tfa intake were 60 from ruminant fats and 40 from phvo this pattern contrasts sharply with those established for canada and the united states where phvo is reported to be the major dietary source of tfa
the composition of trans monoenoic dienoic and trienoic fatty acids in the subcutaneous adipose tissue was analyzed relative to the dietary sources of trans fatty acids ruminant fats and partially hydrogenated oils adipose tissue trans fatty acids from 71 adults were determined using a combination of capillary gasliquid chromatography and silver nitrate thinlayer chromatography the mean total trans fatty acid content of adipose tissue was 2 38  077  in 43 nonpregnant women 2 77  051  in 18 pregnant women and 177  023  in io men total 181 trans isomers were 7585  of total trans fatty acids versus 1618  for total 182 25  for 161 and 0914  for 183 isomers based on the 181 trans content of adipose tissue the population trans consumption is clearly lower than those of the other european countries usa and canada the dietary trans fatty acids were supplied by ruminant fats and partially hydrogenated oils of the 181 trans positional isomers the delta 11 t is the most prevalent in adipose tissue like in ruminant fats suggesting that these ones are an important dietary source of these trans fatty acids
dietary sitostanol has a hypocholesterolemic effect because it decreases the absorption of cholesterol however its effects on the sitostanol concentrations in the blood and tissues are relatively unknown especially in patients with sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis these patients hyperabsorb all sterols and fail to excrete ingested sitosterol and other plant sterols as normal people do the goal of the present study was to examine the absorbability of dietary sitostanol in humans and animals and its potential longterm effect two patients with sitosterolemia were fed the margarine benecol mcneill nutritionals ft washington pa which is enriched in sitostanol and campestanol for 718 wk their plasma cholesterol levels decreased from 180 to 167 mgdl and 153 to 113 mgdl respectively campesterol and sitosterol also decreased however their plasma sitostanol levels increased from 16 to 101 mgdl and from 28 to 79 mgdl respectively plasma campestanol also increased after benecol withdrawal the decline in plasma of both sitostanol and campestanol was very sluggish in an animal study two groups of rats were fed highcholesterol diets with and without sitostanol for 4 wk as expected plasma and liver cholesterol levels decreased 18 and 53 respectively the sitostanol in plasma increased fourfold and sitostanol increased threefold in skeletal muscle and twofold in heart muscle campestanol also increased significantly in both plasma and tissues our data indicate that dietary sitostanol and campestanol are absorbed by patients with sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis and also by rats the absorbed plant stanols were deposited in rat tissues once absorbed by sitosterolemic patients the prolonged retention of sitostanol and campestanol in plasma might increase their atherogenic potential
the present study was designed to examine the effects of increasing dietary levels of vaccenic acid va and cis9 trans11 conjugated linoleic acid cla on chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats both fatty acids were provided as a natural component in butter fat the conversion of va to cla by delta9desaturase was documented previously in several species including rats and humans specifically our objective was to determine the relative contribution of dietary va and cla to the tissue concentration of cla and its ability to inhibit the development of mammary carcinomas a total of 7 diets were formulated with varying levels of cla and va the overall dietary treatment scheme was designed to evaluate the modulation of mammary cancer risk by 1 small increases of cla in the presence of a low level of va and 2 more substantial increases of va against a background of low levels of cla as expected small increases in dietary cla at the low end of the cla doseresponse range did not reduce tumorigenesis in contrast there was a distinct and marked inhibitory response to va that was dose dependent the effect of va was magnified in this experiment because the dose range of va tested was much broader than that of cla fatty acid analysis showed that the conversion of dietary va to cla resulted in a dosedependent increase in the accumulation of cla in the mammary fat pad which was accompanied by a parallel decrease in tumor formation in the mammary gland the finding confirms that the conversion of va to cla is as important for cancer prevention as the dietary supply of cla thus va is also anticarcinogenic and va and cla represent functional food components that are present in ruminant fat
trans fatty acids can be found in foods derived from ruminant animals and foods that contain partially hydrogenated fat such as fast foods the consumption of trans fatty acids is larger in the united states canada and some european countries than in japan and mediterranean countries the incidence of coronary heart diseases is higher in countries where the consumption of trans fatty is high studies show that trans fatty acids can contribute to increase ldl and lipoprotein a and to reduce the levels of hdl in addition trans isomeric seems to inhibit the action of desaturase enzymes of essential fatty acids a5 and a6desaturase by holding back the biosynthesis of important fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid dha with respect to pregnant womens and infants health concentrations of trans fatty acids ingested by the mother are associated to concentrations found in the maternal milk besides the milk the trans fatty acids can be transferred to the newly born through the placenta studies suggest that trans fatty acids can affect intrauterine growth due to the inhibition of the conversion of essential fatty acids by desaturase enzymes the inhibition of dha can also cause early atherosclerosis lesion however studies on the effects of trans fatty acids on health are still inconclusive and there are no current recommendations on their consumption additionally in brazil studies to determine the composition of trans isomeric in foods are still incipient which indicates a great need of research in this area
dietary exposure to transfatty acids tfa is likely to be high among canadian inuit yet no data are available on the physiological effects of tfa in this population the purpose of the present study was to assess the association between tfa and plasma lipid profiles in inuit men and women living in nunavik quebec canada in a crosssectional populationbased survey a total of 795 nunavik inuit eligible participants gave a blood sample exposure to tfa was assessed by their relative proportion in erythrocyte membrane we performed multiple regression analysis using plasma lipids or their linear combinations as the dependent variables and tfa as the main predictor adjusting for potential confounders the associations varied markedly between the sexes and according to age in men n 357 aged 363 so 143 years tfa 124 sd 054  tfa tended to be negatively associated with hdlcholesterol hdlc apoa1 and ldl particle size and positively associated with nonhdlc ldlcholesterol ldlc apob100 the apob00apoa ratio and the ratios of total cholesterol tc ldlc and tag to hdlc no such trends were observed in women it 438 aged 370 so 141 years tfa 116 sd 054  except for hdlc and apoa1 in women aged 50 years and more these results suggest that tfa could raise the risk of chd in inuit men at least through their physiological effects on plasma lipids the differential associations reported in pre and postmenopausal women need to be reproduced in other populations and in experimental studies addressing the influence of sex hormones in response to dietary fats
craigschmidt m c 2001 isomeric fatty acids evaluating status and implications for maternal and child health lipids 369 9971006
isomeric fatty acids is a term that refers to the trans and positional isomers formed during hydrogenation of naturally occurring oils the purposes of this paper are as follows i to summarize potential exposure of infants to isomeric fatty acids by reviewing estimates of isomeric fatty acids in the maternal diet in human milk and in infant formulainfant foods and ii to evaluate the evidence for adverse effects of isomeric fatty acids on infant development with respect to growth and essential fatty acid status estimates of the intake of transfatty acids vary widely both within and across populations current estimates of transfatty acids in the north american population are 411 of total fatty acids or 313 gpersond whereas in mediterranean countries in which olive oil is the primary fat and in far eastern countries in which little commercially hydrogenated fat is consumed per capita consumption of transfatty acids is 12 gd the transfatty acid content of human milk reflects the crosscultural variation in the maternal diet with transfatty acids in human milk samples ranging from 6 to 7 in north america to 05 in hong kong transfatty acids are transferred from the maternal diet through the placenta to the developing fetus or through milk to the breastfed infant in some studies plasma transfatty acids are inversely related to birth weight and head circumference the hypothesis that dietary transfatty acids could inhibit biosynthesis of longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids with 20 and 22 carbon atoms and thus affect infant development is supported by studies demonstrating an inverse correlation of plasma transfatty acids with n3 and n6 longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids in infants however no such relationship has been observed in human milk a definitive answer concerning a potentially adverse effect of dietary transfatty acids on infant development awaits future studies
crupkin m and a zambelli 2008 detrimental impact of trans fats on human health stearic acidrich fats as possible substitutes comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety 73 271279
strong evidence demonstrated the negative effect of trans fatty acid tfa intake on cardiovascular diseases cvd diabetes systemic inflammation and hemostasis as a consequence different regulatory actions have been developed around the world aiming to reduce human consumption of tfa replacement for tfa functionality requires incorporation of plastic and stable saturated fats the present options are palm or fully hydrogenated oils palm oil has been described as responsible for negative biological effects on serum cholesterol levels and cvd risk different epidemiological and clinical studies recommend reduction of saturated fatty acid sfa intake mainly myristic and palmitic acids experimental evidence strongly suggests that stearic acid is a wholesome substitute for tfas and other sfas in food manufacturing in this article biological effects of stearic acid on human health are reviewed in comparison to tfas sfas and unsaturated fatty acids current revised understanding on dietary intake digestion and absorption is also covered
conjugated linoleic acids cla are octadecadienoic acids 182 that have a conjugated doublebond system interest in these compounds has expanded since cla were found to be associated with a number of physiological and pathological responses such as cancer metastases atherosclerosis diabetes immunity and body fatprotein composition the main sources of these conjugated fatty acids are dairy fats rumen bacteria convert polyunsaturated fatty acids especially linoleic and linolenic acids to cla and numerous transcontaining mono and diunsaturated fatty acids it has been established that an additional route of cla synthesis in ruminants and monogastric animals including humans occurs via delta9 desaturation of the trans181 isomers to date a total of 6 positional cla isomers have been found in dairy fats each occurring in 4 geometric forms cistrans transcis ciscis and transtrans for a total of 24 all of these cla isomers can be resolved only by a combination of gas chromatography gc using 100 m highly polar capillary columns and silverion liquid chromatography using 3 of these 25 cm columns in series complete analysis of all the trans181 isomers requires prior isolation of trans monoenes by silverion thinlayer chromatography tlc followed by gc analysis using the same 100 m capillary columns operated at low temperatures starting from 120degreesc these analytical techniques are required to assess the purity of commercial cla preparations because their purity will affect the interpretation of any physiological andor biochemical response obtained prior assessment of cla preparations by tlc is also recommended to determine the presence of any other impurities the availability of pure cla isomers will permit the evaluation and analysis of individual cla isomers for their nutritional and biological activity in model systems animals and humans these techniques are also essential to evaluate dairy fats for their content of specific cla isomers and to help design experimental diets to increase the level of the desired cla isomers in dairy fats these improved techniques are further required to evaluate the cla profile in monogastric animals fed commercial cla preparations for cla enrichment of animal products this is particularly important because absorption and metabolism will alter the ingestedcla profile in the animal fed
objective to describe the relative contribution of 10 created food groups to total fat intake in middleaged subjects the relationship of added oil and fat intake with region of residence and educational level was also assessed design crosssectional study subjectssetting participants of the french supplementation en vitamines et mineraux antioxydants study who completed at least six 24hour dietary records after inclusion into the study n6572 results added oils and fats were the main source of total fat intake animal fat and margarine intakes showed a significant inverse association with educational level whereas oils with monounsaturated fatty acids mufa were positively associated with education level animal fat intake was significantly higher in the western and northern parts of france 542 and 504 and lower in the mediterranean coast 390 a significant inverse gradient was found with oils with polyunsaturated fatty acids or mufa in the southwest and the mediterranean coast compared with the northern part of france conclusions we showed a north to south gradient for animal fat intake and the opposite for oils with mufa and polyunsaturated fatty acid in france this gradient parallels the known disparities for cardiovascular mortality in this country this should contribute to adapting dietary guidelines for dietary change in a public health perspective
dalainas i and h p ioannou 2008 the role of trans fatty acids in atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease and infant development international angiology 272 146156
the process of partial hydrogenation converts vegetable oils in semisolid fats like margarines that contain high concentrations of trans fatty acids tfa and are commonly used in bakery as well as for deep frying in fast food chains and other restaurants initially these fats were considered the healthy solution because they substituted butter and other cholesterol fats however in the last decades there has been continuing accumulation of evidence that tfa have potential harmful action in blood lipid metabolism atherosclerosis development and cardiovascular disease as well as in infant development consequently many countries have enacted in order to reduce total tfa percentage in the daily fat intake while others are waiting strongest evidence to enact this article reviews the evidence of the effects of tfa in relation to atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease inflammation and diabetes and infant development
growing consumer interest in grassfed beef products has raised a number of questions with regard to the perceived differences in nutritional quality between grassfed and grainfed cattle research spanning three decades suggests that grassbased diets can significantly improve the fatty acid fa composition and antioxidant content of beef albeit with variable impacts on overall palatability grassbased diets have been shown to enhance total conjugated linoleic acid cla c182 isomers trans vaccenic acid tva c181 t11 a precursor to cla and omega3 n3 fas on a gg fat basis while the overall concentration of total sfas is not different between feeding regimens grassfinished beef tends toward a higher proportion of cholesterol neutral stearic fa c18 0 and less cholesterolelevating sfas such as myristic c140 and palmitic c160 fas several studies suggest that grassbased diets elevate precursors for vitamin a and e as well as cancer fighting antioxidants such as glutathione gt and superoxide dismutase sod activity as compared to grainfed contemporaries fat conscious consumers will also prefer the overall lower fat content of a grassfed beef product however consumers should be aware that the differences in fa content will also give grassfed beef a distinct grass flavor and unique cooking qualities that should be considered when making the transition from grainfed beef in addition the fat from grassfinished beef may have a yellowish appearance from the elevated carotenoid content precursor to vitamin a it is also noted that grainfed beef consumers may achieve similar intakes of both n3 and cla through the consumption of higher fat grainfed portions
the objective of this study was to compare the longterm effects of oleic cis 181 elaidic trans 181 and palmitic 160 acids on hepatic lipoprotein production using hepg2 cells as an experimental model the net accumulation in the medium of apolipoprotein ai apoiai was not significantly altered by fatty acids whereas that of apob was increased with oleic and elaidic acids oleic acid and to a lesser extent elaidic and palmitic acids increased the mass of triglycerides in the medium and the incorporation of h3glycerol into secreted triglycerides the incorporation of c14acetate into cellular and secreted total cholesterol was stimulated by 96 and 83 respectively with elaidic acid but was not significantly modified by oleic or palmitic acid relative to oleic acid the secretion of c14labeled phospholipids and triglycerides was decreased 28 to 31 with elaidic and palmitic acids whereas that of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters was enhanced 93 and 73 respectively with elaidic acid but remained unchanged with palmitic acid compared with oleic acid elaidic acid stimulated the secretion of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol vldlchol low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldlchol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdlchol by 43 70 and 34 respectively whereas palmitic acid decreased vldlchol but had no significant effect on ldlchol and hdlchol the ratios of total cholesterol to hdlchol were 317 360 and 325 with oleic elaidic and palmitic acids respectively the corresponding ratios of ldlchol to hdlchol were 087 110 and 093 respectively compared with oleic and palmitic acids the ldl and hdl particles secreted in the presence of elaidic acid contained higher levels of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters and a lower content of phospholipids the phospholipidtototal cholesterol ratios of hdl were 105 040 and 076 with oleic elaidic and palmitic acids respectively our results indicate that in comparison with cis monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids trans fatty acids have more adverse effects on the concentration and composition of lipoproteins secreted by hepg2 cells
this paper describes an operationally simple rapid hydrogenation of unsaturated sterols and bile alcohols in a domestic microwave oven this has been achieved by the addition of catalytic amounts of pdc in methylene chloridepropylene glycol solvents in the presence of ammonium formate followed by microwave irradiation it is suggested that this methodology will be helpful in the identification of saturated and unsaturated sterols with different sidechain structures in rare diseases sitosterolemia cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ctx as well as atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus sterols such as cholesterol campesterol sitosterol and bile alcohols with unsaturated side chains were converted to their reduced congeners with high yield and purity c 1997 by elsevier science inc
objective this study analyzed serum lipids and hepatics morphological changes in rats fed different lipid sources soybean oil fish fat and lard margarine and butter methods fifty wistar rats were divided into five groups they were given semisynthetic diets with different lipid sources for 28 days soybean oil lard butter margarine and fish fat body weight food intake food efficiency coefficient lipoprotein lipase activity serum concentrations of total cholesterol and high density lipoproteincholesterol triacylglycerols and albumin were assessed the heart and liver tissues underwent histological assessment results the type of lipid source did not influence food intake weight gain or food efficiency coefficient the activity of the lipoprotein lipase was also unaffected however there were changes in the serum concentration of total cholesterol high density lipoproteincholesterol triacylglycerols and albumin all groups presented lipid droplets on the coronary walls and heart capillaries the fat deposition on the liver of animals given soybean oil fish fat and lard and butter was characterized as steatosis conclusion the lipid source that presented the best results was soybean oil fish fat affected the serum and tissues similarly to other lipid sources lard butter and margarine this may contribute to the onset and progression of cardiovascular diseases
objective to analyze the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated trans fatty acid intake among the general population methods a crosssectional study was conducted in sao paulo southeastern brazil in 2003 on a representative sample of 2298 male and female subjects including 803 adolescents 12 to 19 years 713 adults 20 to 59 years and 782 elderly people 60 years or over food intake was measured using 24hour recall mean trans fatty acid intake was described according to gender and age group results the mean trans fatty acid intake was 50 gday se  01 accounting for 24 se  01 of total energy and 68 se  01 of total lipids the adolescents had the highest mean intake levels 74 gday 29 of energy while the adults and the elderly had similar intake 22 of energy for both 64 of lipids and 65 of lipids respectively the mean trans fatty acid intake among adult and elderly women approximately 25 of energy and 70 of lipids was higher than among men in the same age group the food item with the highest contribution towards trans fatty acids was margarine accounting for more than 30 of total intake followed by filled cookies among adolescents and meat among adults and the elderly conclusions the trans fatty acid intake is above the level recommended by the world health organization replacement of the trans fatty acids in manufactured food items may be an effective measure for reducing trans fatty acid intake in brazil
objective the present study was designed to examine for the first time sidebyside the effects of plant sterol and stanol consumption on lipid metabolism and markers of antioxidant status oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction and lowgrade inflammation in subjects on stable statintreatment design doubleblind randomized placebocontrolled intervention trial setting university subjects fortyfive patients on current statin treatment were recruited via newspaper advertisements data of 41 patients were used in statistical analysis intervention subjects consumed margarine with no added plant sterols or stanols for 4 weeks and were then divided into three groups of 15 subjects for the next 16 weeks one group continued with the control margarine and the other two groups with either a plant sterol or stanol 25 gdayenriched margarine blood was sampled at the end of the runin and intervention periods results plant sterol and stanol consumption significantly p  0026 reduced lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol by 034 mmoll 95 confidence interval ci 067 to 004 mmoll no effects were shown on enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants and markers of oxidative modification of lipids and dna in addition no effect was found on soluble adhesion molecules creactive protein and monocyte chemotactic protein1 concentrations conclusions we conclude that 16 weeks of plant sterol or stanol consumption did not affect markers of antioxidant status oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction and lowgrade inflammation in patients on stable statin treatment despite a significant reduction of ldl cholesterol

aim to summarize our present knowledge about vegetable omega3 fatty acids data synthesis alphalinolenic acid ala is one of the two essential fatty acids in humans epidemiological studies and dietary trials strongly suggest that this fatty acid is important in relation with the pathogenesis and prevention of coronary heart disease like other n3 fatty acids from marine origin it may prevent cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death the optimal dietary intake of alphalinolenic acid seems to be about 2 g per day or 06 to 1 of total energy intake obtaining an optimal ratio of the two essential fatty acids linoleic and alphalinolenic acids  ie a ratio of less than 4 to 1 in the diet  is a major issue the main sources of alphalinolenic acid for the european population should be canola oil and canolaoil based margarine if available nuts english walnut ground linseeds and green leafy vegetables such as purslane conclusions epidemiological studies and dietary trials in humans suggest that alphalinolenic acid is a major cardioprotective nutrient c 2004 medikal press

objectives to discuss present knowledge about mediterranean diet and cardiovascular diseases design review of existing literature setting and results epidemiological studies as well as randomised dietary trials suggest that mediterranean diet may be important in relation to the pathogenesis and prevention of chd for instance a striking protective effect of an alarich mediterranean diet was reported in the lyon diet heart study with a 50 to 70 reduction of the risk of recurrence after 4 years of followup in chd patients according to our current knowledge dietary ala should represent about 06 to 1 of total daily energy or about 2 g per day in patients following a mediterranean diet whereas the average intake in linoleic acid should not exceed 7 g per day supplementation with verylongchain omega3 fatty acids about 1 g per day in patients following a mediterranean type of diet was shown to decrease the risk of cardiac death by 30 and of sudden cardiac death by 45 in the gissi trial conclusions in the context of a diet rich in oleic acid poor in saturated fats and low in omega6 fatty acids a dietary pattern characterising the traditional mediterranean diet even small doses of omega3 fatty acids about 1 g epadha the form of fish oil capsules or 2 g alphalinolenic acid in canola oil and margarine might be very protective these data underline the importance of the accompanying diet in any dietary strategy using fatty acid complements
dietary fatty acids have a profound impact on atherosclerosis but mechanisms are not fully understood we studied the effects of a saturated fat diet supplemented with fish oil trans10cis12 conjugated linoleic acid cla or elaidic acid on lipid and glucose metabolism and liver protein levels of apoe3 leiden transgenic mice a model for lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis fish oil lowered plasma and liver cholesterol and triglycerides plasma free fatty acids and glucose but increased plasma insulin cla lowered plasma cholesterol but increased plasma and liver triglycerides plasma betahydroxybutyrate and insulin elaidic acid lowered plasma and liver cholesterol proteomics identified significant regulation of 65 cytosolic and 8membrane proteins many of these proteins were related to lipid and glucose metabolism and to oxidative stress principal component analysis revealed that fish oil had a major impact on cytosolic proteins and elaidic acid on membrane proteins correlation analysis between physiological and protein data revealed novel clusters of correlated variables among which a metabolic syndrome cluster the combination of proteomics and physiology gave new insights in mechanisms by which these dietary fatty acids regulate lipid metabolism and related pathways for example by altering protein levels of longchain acylcoa thioester hydrolase and adipophilin in the liver
consumption of industrial trans fat raises the risk of cardiovascular disease but it is unclear whether cis9 trans11conjugated linoleic acid cla  a trans fatty acid in dairy products modulates disease development we investigated the effects of complete diets providing 7 of energy as industrial trans fat or cis9 trans11 cla compared with oleic acid on regulation of plasma proteins in 12 healthy men diets were provided for 3 wk each in random order plasma was collected at the end of each 3 wk intervention period depleted of its 12 most abundant proteins and analyzed by 2de principal component analysis of protein spot intensity values revealed that the nature of the dietary intervention did not significantly affect the plasma proteome the intervention provided in the 1st period produced a significant treatment effect compared with the interventions provided in the other two periods and there was a significant subject effect in conclusion the nature of an extreme dietary intervention ie 7 of energy provided by industrial trans fat or cis9 trans11 cla did not markedly affect the plasma proteome thus plasma proteomics using 2de appears by and large an unsuitable approach to detect regulation of plasma proteins due to changes in the diet
solid fats are used in food manufacturing to provide texture and firmness to foods such fats are rich in either saturated or transfatty acids both of which increase the risk of coronary heart disease epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that transfatty acids increase risk more than do saturates because they lower serum high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol however there appear to be differences between saturates in their effect on hdl cholesterol we investigated whether the consumption of a solid fat rich in lauric acid c120 would result in a more favorable blood lipid profile than the consumption of a solid fat rich in transfatty acids we fed 32 healthy men and women two controlled diets in a 2 x 4wk randomized crossover design the diets consisted of a background diet supplemented with margarines in the transdiet 92 of energy was provided by transfatty acids and 129 by saturated fatty acids in the satdiet energy intake was 0 from transfatty acids and 229 from saturated fatty acids lauric acid composed one third of all saturates in the satdiet serum hdl cholesterol was 036 mmoll lower at the end of the transdiet than at the end of the satdiet 95 confidence interval 046 to 026 whereas serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations remained stable serum total cholesterol was 031 mmoll 95 confidence interval 048 to 014 lower at the end of the transdiet than at the end of the satdiet consumption of a solid fat rich in lauric acid gives a more favorable serum lipoprotein pattern than consumption of partially hydrogenated soybean oil rich in transfatty acids thus solid fats rich in lauric acids such as tropical fats appear to be preferable to transfats in food manufacturing where hard fats are indispensable
inhibition of intercellular communication is an important feature in the tumour promotion phase of a multistage carcinogenesis model in atherosclerosis inhibition of cellcell communication by atherogenic compounds eg low density lipoproteins ldl also seems to be important for testing atherogenic compounds we used an atherosclerosis relevant cell type namely human smooth muscle cells in order to investigate which part of the ldl particle would be involved in inhibition of metabolic cooperation between human smooth muscle cells in culture we tested several fatty acids and their breakdown products namely aldehydes unsaturated c18 fatty acids markedly influenced gapjunctional intercellular communication gjic whereas saturated c180 c160 and unsaturated fatty acids with 20 carbon atoms did not inhibit gjic in the case of oleic and elaidic acid orientation seemed important however after exposure to palmitoleic and palmitelaidic acid no differences were found the most potent inhibitor of gjic was linoleic acid which inhibited gjic by 75 no correlation was found between degrees of unsaturation and ability to inhibit gjic of the tested aldehydes hexanal propanal butanal and 4hydroxynonenal did significantly inhibit gjic while pentanal had no effect since modification of ldl was shown to be important in order for ldl to inhibit gjic these results show that fatty acids and their oxidative breakdown products may be of importance for the inhibition of gjic by ldl
consumption of foods and supplements enriched with plant sterolsstanols ps may help reduce lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc levels in this review we consider the effects of ps beyond ldlc lowering plant sterolsstanols exert beneficial effects on other lipid variables such as apolipoprotein apo bapoai ratio and in some studies highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc and triglycerides tg plant sterolsstanols may also affect inflammatory markers coagulation parameters as well as platelet and endothelial function evidence also exists about a beneficial effect on oxidative stress but this does not seem to be of greater degree than that expected from the ldlc lowering many of these effects have been demonstrated in vitro and animal models some in vitro effects cannot be seen in vivo or in humans at usual doses the epidemiological studies that evaluated the association of plasma ps concentration with cardiovascular disease cvd risk do not provide a definitive answer longterm randomized placebocontrolled studies are required to clarify the effects of supplementation with ps on cvd risk and progression of atherosclerosis
objective  hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease therapeutic lifestyle changes include dietary modifications such as inclusion of phytosterols which effectively lowers lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol in margarines and other fats their effectiveness in nonfat moieties is not yet established the aim of this study was to examine if phytosterols alter the plasma lipoprotein profile when incorporated into nonfat orange juice methods and results  after a 2week runin phase with orange juice 72 mildly hypercholesterolemic healthy subjects were randomized to receive either placebo orange juice  placebo oj or plant sterolfortified orange juice  sterol oj 2gd for 8 weeks fasting blood was obtained at baseline after 2 weeks of oj and after 8 weeks of placebosteroloj supplementation sterol oj supplementation significantly decreased total 72 ldl 124 and nonhighdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol 78 compared with baseline and compared with placebo oj  p  001 apolipoprotein b levels were significantly decreased 95 with sterol oj there were no significant changes in hdl cholesterol or triglycerides with the sterol oj while folate and b12 levels significantly increased homocysteine levels were unchanged conclusions  orange juice fortified with plant sterols are effective in reducing ldl cholesterol and could easily be incorporated into the therapeutic lifestyle changes dietary regimen

trans fatty acids have the presence of one or more double bonds in the trans configuration instead of the usual cis configuration they are desired by vanaspati industry as they impart firmness to margarines and plasticity as well as emulsion stability to shortenings research has proved the direct connection of trans fatty acids with cardiovascular diseases breast cancer shortening of pregnancy period risks of preeclampsia disorders of nervous system and vision in infants colon cancer diabetes obesity and allergy in light of these new findings trans fatty intake should be zero and new technology of hydrogenation of oils is to be developed which produce zero trans fatty acids at the same time preserve the desirable properties contributed by trans fatty acids to the hydrogenated oils presently in india there is no system to monitor and regulate the amount of trans fats in processed foods and hence a stringent food law is immediately required
background transfatty acids tfa are known as a risk factor for coronary artery diseases insulin resistance and obesity accompanied by systemic inflammation the features of metabolic syndrome little is known about the effects on the liver induced by lipids and also few studies are focused on the effect of foods rich in tfas on hepatic functions and oxidative stress this study investigates whether highfat diets with different tfa levels induce oxidative stress and liver dysfunction in rats methods male wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups n  12group c receiving standardchow experimental groups that were fed highfat diet included 20 fresh soybean oil diet fso 20 oxidized soybean oil diet oso and 20 margarine diet mg each group was kept on the treatment for 4 weeks results a liver damage was observed in rats fed with highfat diet via increase of liver lipid peroxidation and decreased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase the intake of oxidized oil led to higher levels of lipid peroxidation and a lower concentration of plasma antioxidants in comparison to rats fed with fso the higher inflammatory response in the liver was induced by mg diet liver histopathology from oso and mg groups showed respectively moderate to severe cytoplasm vacuolation hypatocyte hypertrophy hepatocyte ballooning and necroinflammation conclusion it seems that a strong relationship exists between the consumption of tfa in the oxidized oils and lipid peroxidation and non alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld the extent of the peroxidative events in liver was also different depending on the fat source suggesting that feeding margarine with higher tfa levels may represent a direct source of oxidative stress for the organism the present study provides evidence for a direct effect of tfa on nafld
trans isomers of dietary fatty acids generated during the commercial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats may contribute to coronary heart disease chd in humans by interfering with lipid metabolism to examine this possibility in a fatsensitive model the mongolian gerbil meriones unguiculatus was used to compare the cholesterolemic and triglyceridemic potential of modest increments of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated soybean oil with other saturated fatty acids in the presence and absence of dietary cholesterol age dose and timedependent effects were examined in weanling 6monthold and 1yearold gerbils although lipoprotein metabolism in weanling gerbils was initially refractory to trans fat even as perturbations by saturated fatty acids were demonstrable these gerbils eventually after 16 weeks developed a transinduced hypercholesterolemia that was intermediate between the response to 160 and 120  140 the hepatic and plasma 181182 cholesteryl ester ce ratio was depressed by trans in a manner similar to saturated fatty acids the 6monthold gerbils readily developed hypertriglyceridemia but not hypercholesterolemia again revealing a decrease in the plasma 181182 ce ratio the 1yearold gerbils revealed a doserelated 0 5 10en as trans elevation in total cholesterol tc and especially triglycerides tg that was accentuated by 004 dietary cholesterol increases in plasma lipids were again accompanied by a significant decrease in the mass of hepatic esterified cholesterol particularly 181cholesteryl esters thus dietary transfatty acids induce age time and dosedependent modulations in gerbil plasma lipids associated with decreased 181 cholesteryl esters further investigation with gerbils may reveal mechanisms by which trans fat consumption disturbs lipoprotein metabolism
high stearic low alphalinolenic acid soybean oil hsll has been developed via traditional breeding to serve as a substitute for partially hydrogenated soybean oils used in food manufacturing the purpose of this study was to estimate the impact on fatty acid intake in the united states if hsll were substituted for partially hydrogenated soybean oils used in several food categories including baked goods shortenings fried foods and margarines using national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes data 19992002 baseline intakes of five fatty acids and trans fatty acids tfa were determined at the mean and 90th percentile of fat consumption then intakes of these fatty acids were determined after hsll was substituted for 100 of the partially hydrogenated soybean oils used in these four food categories the results show that baseline intake of stearic acid is 30 energy at the mean and 33 energy at the 90th percentile use of hsll could increase stearic acid intake to about 45 energy mean intakes of tfa could decrease from 25 to 09 energy and intake of palmitic acid would remain unchanged use of hsll as a substitute for partially hydrogenated soybean oils would result in changes in the fatty acid composition of the us diet consistent with current dietary recommendations

recommendations about the use of plant stanolsterol esters have not been updated since 2001 there have been many developments in medicines for lipidlowering since 2001 in this review the use of margarines containing stanol or sterol esters to lower ldl cholesterol is considered in the 2011 setting firstly there is a brief overview of the effects of the stanolssterols on ldl cholesterol which shows that these agents have a modest ability to lower ldl cholesterol and are not effective in all conditions secondly the relevance of the stanolssterols in 20101 is questioned given they have not been shown to reduce clinical endpoints and have no effects on hdl cholesterol or triglyceride levels finally there is a section comparing the stanolssterols with the present day prescription lipid lowering medicines prescription drugs statins ezetimibe and niacin have a much greater ability to lower ldl cholesterol than the stanolsterol esters and also increase levels of hdl cholesterol and decrease levels of triglycerides the statins and niacin have been shown to reduce cardiovascular clinical endpoints except in borderline normohypercholesterolemia prescription drugs should be preferred to stanolsterol esters for lowering ldl cholesterol in 2011 c 2011 published by elsevier ltd
the synthesis and bioactivities of danshensu derivatives rmethyl 2acetoxy334diacetoxyphenyl propanoate 1a rmethyl 2acetoxy334methylenedioxyphenyl propanoate 1b and their racemates 7 and 10 were reported in this paper these derivatives were designed to improve their chemical stability and liposolubility by protecting danshensus phenolic hydroxyl groups with acetyl or methylene which could be readily hydrolyzed to release bioactive danshensu the asymmetric synthesis of 1a and 1b were achieved by catalytic hydrogenation of zmethyl 2acetoxy334diacetoxyphenyl2propenoate 6a and zmethyl 2acetoxy334methylenedioxyphenyl2propenoate 6b in excellent enantiomeric excesses 92 ee and 98 ee respectively and good yields 89 an unexpected intermediate product z2acetoxy334dihydroxyphenyl acrylic acid 4c was obtained with high chemoselectivity in 86 yield by keeping the reaction temperature at 60 degrees c and its structure was identified by xray single crystal diffraction analysis 1a 1b and their racemates 7 10 as well as 4c exhibited potent protective activities against hypoxiainduced cellular damage the in vitro test showed that all these compounds could increase cell viability and inhibit lipid hyperoxidation furthermore 1a and 4c could inhibit apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosisrelated molecule in gene and protein levels upregulating the expression of bcl2 and downregulating bax and caspase3 the in vivo test indicated that 4c exhibited antimyocardial ischemic effects featured by reducing infarction size and increasing the level of the intracellular enzymes detectable in serum therefore these danshensu derivatives may be good drug candidates for antimyocardial ischemia therapy and merit further investigation c 2009 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
in ruminants extensive ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids fa results in numerous cis and trans isomers of 181 and of conjugated and nonconjugated 18 2 the incorporation of which into ruminant products depends on the composition of the diet forage vs concentrate and of dietary lipid supplements the low amount of 183n3 alphalinolenic acid absorbed explains its limited incorporation in meat and milk lipids its protection against hydrogenation has been an objective for several decades but only encapsulation in a protein matrix is efficient in nonruminants the fa composition of products is determined by dietary fa despite minor differences in digestibility and in metabolic activity physicochemical differences in intestinal absorption processes between ruminants and nonruminants can explain the lower fa digestibility in nonruminants especially for saturated fa unlike in nonruminants fa digestibility in ruminants does not depend on fa intake except for 180 the decrease in cow butterfat especially with concentrate diets is generally attributed to t10181 or t10 c12182 but the regulation is probably more complex differences in terms of butterfat content and fa composition of milk between cow ewe and goat responses to the amount and composition of ingested lipids are due to betweenspecies variations in mammary metabolism in animals bred for meat production dietary 18 3n3 results in increases in this fa and in n3 longchain polyunsaturated fa 205n3 225n3 in muscles the extent of this increase depends both on animal and nutritional factors grass is a source of 183n3 which contributes to increased 183n3 in muscle of ruminants as well as of pigs conjugated linoleic acids are mainly present in fat tissues and milk due to t11181 desaturation their concentration depends on tissue type and on animal species nonruminants fed synthetic conjugated linoleic acids incorporate them in significant amounts in muscle depending on the isomer all dietary manipulations favouring polyunsaturated fa incorporation in milk and meat lipids increase the risk of lipoperoxidation which can be efficiently prevented by use of dietary combined hydroand lipophilic antioxidants in the diet putative effects on organoleptic and technological quality of products deserve further studies
dietary transfatty acids are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and have been implicated in the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm it is established that highfat saturated diets relative to lowfat diets induce adiposity and wholebody insulin resistance here we test the hypothesis that markers of an obese prediabetic state fatty liver visceral fat accumulation insulin resistance are also worsened with provision of a lowfat diet containing elaidic acid 18 1t the predominant transfatty acid isomer found in the human food supply male 8weekold spraguedawley rats were fed a 10 transfatty acid enriched lftrans diet for 8 weeks at baseline 3 and 6 weeks in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy 1hmr assessed intramyocellular lipid imcl and intrahepatic lipid ihl content euglycemichyperinsulinemic clamps week 8 determined wholebody and tissuespecific insulin sensitivity followed by highresolution ex vivo 1hnmr to assess tissue biochemistry rats fed the lftrans diet were in positive energy balance largely explained by increased energy intake and showed significantly increased visceral fat and liver lipid accumulation relative to the lowfat control diet net glycogen synthesis was also increased in the lftrans group a reduction in glucose disposal independent of imcl accumulation was observed in rats fed the lftrans diet whereas in rats fed a 45 saturated fat hfsat diet impaired glucose disposal corresponded to increased imclta neither diet induced an increase in imclsoleus these findings imply that transfatty acids may alter nutrient handling in liver adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and that the mechanism by which transfatty acids induce insulin resistance differs from diets enriched with saturated fats
dietary fatty acids alter hdl cholesterol concentrations presumably through mechanisms related to reverse cholesterol transport the effect of dietary fats coconut oil butter traditional stick margarine soybean oil canola oil differing in fatty acid profile on this antiatherogenic process was assessed with respect to plasma lipids exogenous and endogenous lecithincholesterol acyltransferase lcat cholesterol ester transfer protein cetp phospholipid transfer protein pltp activities and lcat apolipoprotein apo ai and scavenger receptor b class1 srb1 mrna abundance goldensyrian hamsters were fed a nonpurified 625 g100 g fat diet containing an additional 10 g100 g experimental fat and 01 g100 g cholesterol for 6 wk canola and soybean oils significantly lowered serum hdl cholesterol concentrations relative to butter canola oil relative to butter resulted in higher exogenous lcat activity and both soybean and canola oils significantly increased hepatic apo ai and srb1 mrna abundance butter relative to margarine coconut and soybean oils significantly increased serum nonhdl cholesterol concentrations endogenous and exogenous lcat cetp and pltp activities did not differ in hamsters fed margarine or saturated fat diets despite lower hepatic lcat apo ai and srb1 mrna abundance suggesting that changes in available substrate andor modification to the lcat protein may have been involved in lipoprotein changes these results suggest that lower hdl cholesterol concentrations as a result of canola and soybean oil feeding may not be detrimental due to increases in components involved in the reverse cholesterol transport process in these hamsters and may retard the progression of atherosclerosis
objective to systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of policies including selfregulation aimed at reducing industrially produced trans fatty acids tfas in food methods the medline embase and cinahl databases were searched to identify peerreviewed articles examining the effect of tfa policies in addition the first 20 pages of google searches were examined for articles from the grey literature a study was included if i it was empirical and conducted in a realworld setting ie modelling studies were excluded ii it examined a tfa policy involving for example labelling voluntary limits or bans and iii it examined a policys effect on tfa levels in food peoples diets blood or breast milk findings twentysix articles met the inclusion criteria 5 involved voluntary selfregulation 8 labelling alone 4 labelling and voluntary limits 5 local bans and 4 national bans overall the tfa content of food decreased with all types of policy intervention in general saturated fat levels increased or decreased depending on the product type and total fat content remained stable national and local bans were most effective at eliminating tfas from the food supply whereas mandatory tfa labelling and voluntary tfa limits had a varying degree of success which largely depended on food category conclusion policies aimed at restricting the tfa content of food were associated with significant reductions in tfa levels without increasing total fat content such policies are feasible achievable and likely to have an effect on public health
omega3 fatty acids contain a double bond in the third position from the methyl group the very longchain 20 or 22 carbon atoms omega3 fatty acids are mostly found in fatty fish and fish oils the omega3 fatty acids are essential and may act as precursors for eicosanoids altering membrane fluidity or binding to transcription factors dietary intake of omega3 fatty acids reduces plasma concentration of triglycerides probably by decreasing hepatic secretion of very low density lipoprotein vldl and by increasing catabolism of chylomicrons in addition lipid peroxidation of omega3 fatty acids may take place with good and bad consequences as the number of double bonds is high the omega3 fatty acids may easily react with oxygen radicals we performed studies where 5 gday of very longchain omega3 fatty acids was given as a supplement for four months along with vitamin e whereas control groups received similar amounts of other oils the unsaturation index was higher in fatty acids of ldl from individuals exposed to omega3 fatty acids and the amounts of cholesteryl esters and total lipids were lower compared with control ldl whereas similar electrophoretic mobility and apolipoprotein b structure were observed there was a decrease in the melting temperature of cholesteryl esters in omega3 fatty acidenriched ldl but no change in the susceptibility of ldl to cu2 catalyzed lipid peroxidation as measured by changes in amounts of lipid peroxides or in the uptake of ldl im macrophages these data have been verified by others whereas three publications reported that fish oil supplementation was associated with increased sings of lipid peroxidation recently it has been shown that peroxidation of ldl by white blood cells might be reduced by increased cellular content of omega3 fatty acids in conclusion the susceptibility of ldl to in vitro peroxidation may be increased with dietary intake of omega3 fatty acids unless adequate amounts of antioxidants are provided reduced intake of foods with high content of saturated fatty acids fatty milk products meat hard margarines and increased intake of foods providing high amounts of omega3 fatty acids fatty fish and antioxidants fruits vegetables are recommended these precautions will most likely promote reduced incidence of coronary artery disease inflammatory diseases and certain forms of cancer
recently a food pattern predictive for prospective weight change was identified within the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutritionpotsdam cohort given the possible impact of weight change on cardiovascular disease cvd risk we examined the association between the above mentioned food pattern and risk of cvd the analyzed food pattern was defined by a high consumption of wholegrain bread fruits fruit juices grain flakes andor cereals and raw vegetables and a low consumption of processed meat butter highfat cheese margarine and meat other than poultry the associations between quartiles of the food pattern score and cvd morbidity and mortality were examined in 26238 subjects of the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutritionpotsdam cohort using a coxs proportional hazards model for competing risks during 64 y of followup 379 incident cases of cvd were identified of which 68 were fatal events the food pattern was not associated with risk of nonfatal cvd after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors the hazard ratios for fatal cvd across increasing quartiles of the score were 100 085 031 and 047 respectively p for trend  0016 the association of the food pattern with cvd risk differed between fatal and nonfatal events p for difference  005 these findings from a large german cohort indicate that a food pattern predicting prospective weight change may be associated with the risk of fatal cvd
vaccenic acid trans11c181 chemically resembles elaidic acid trans9c181 which is assumed to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and thus could exert similar effects possible different oxidation rates of vaccenic versus elaidic acid were checked in muscles and liver and through related gene expression in normal rat liver cells in hepatic mitochondria carnitine palmitoyltransferase cpt i exhibited comparable activity rates with both transisomers cpt ii activity was 30 greater p  005 with vaccenic than with elaidic acid as nonesterified fatty acids nefas or acylcoas activity of the first betaoxidation step was similar between the isomers in all the tissue slices and liver extracts assayed respiration rates were comparable with both transisomers as nefas in various liver extracts but were 30 greater p  005 with vaccenoylcoa than with elaidoylcoa in liver mitochondria vaccenic acid was oxidised 25 more p  005 by liver peroxisomes than elaidic acid in hepatocytes cultured with trans and corresponding cisc181 isomers gene expression of cpt i hydroxyacylcoa dehydrogenase and hydroxymethylglutarylcoa synthase was at least 100 increased p  005 but was unchanged with vaccenic acid relative to controls in conclusion the position and geometry of the double bonds in acyl chains are suggested to confer on vaccenic and elaidic acid specific biochemical properties that might differently affect their fates in tissues
elaidic acid trans9c181 or trans9 is assumed to exert atherogenic effects due to its double bond configuration the possibility that trans9 and vaccenic acid trans11c181 or trans11 its positional isomer were biochemically equivalent and interchangeable compounds was investigated by reference to their cisisomers through esterificationrelated activities using rat liver cells and subcellular fractions in hepatocytes both transc181 were incorporated to the same extent in triacylglycerols but trans9 was more esterified than trans11 into phospholipids p  005 glycerol3phosphate acyltransferase activity in microsomes was lower with trans11 than with trans9 while this activity in mitochondria was similar to 40 greater with trans11 than with trans9 p  005 activity of 2lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase in microsomes was of comparable extent with both trans isomers but activity of 2lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase was significantly greater with trans9 than with trans11 at p  001 lipoproteins secreted by hepatocytes reached equivalent levels in the presence of any isomers but triacylglycerol production was more elevated with trans11 than with trans9 at p  005 cholesterol efflux from previously labelled hepatocytes was lower with trans11 than with trans9 when these cells were exposed to either transc181 the gene expression of proteins involved in fatty acid esterification and lipoprotein synthesis was unaffected which indicates that the biochemical differences essentially depended on enzymesubstrate affinities on the whole vaccenic and elaidic acid were shown to incorporate cell phospholipids unequally at least in vitro which suggests they can differently affect lipid metabolic pathways in normal cells

functional foods and dietary supplements might have a role in supporting drug therapy these products may 1 have an additive effect to the effect that a drug has in reducing risk factors associated with certain conditions 2 contribute to improve risk factors associated with the condition other than the risk factor that the drug is dealing with or 3 reduce drugassociated side effects for example by restoring depleted compounds or by reducing the necessary dose of the drug possible advantages compared with a multidrug therapy are lower drug costs fewer side effects and increased adherence in the present review we have focused on the support of statin therapy using functional foods or dietary supplements containing plant sterols andor stanols soluble dietary fibre n3 pufa or coenzyme q10 we conclude that there is substantial evidence that adding plant sterols andor stanols to statin therapy further reduces total and ldlcholesterol by roughly 6 and 10 respectively adding n3 pufa to statin therapy leads to a significant reduction in plasma tag of at least 15 data are insufficient and not conclusive to recommend the use of soluble fibre or coenzyme q10 in patients on statin therapy and more randomised controlled trials towards these combinations are warranted aside from the possible beneficial effects from functional foods or dietary supplements on drug therapy it is important to examine possible negative effects from the combination in the long term for example in postmarketing surveillance studies moreover it is important to monitor whether the functional foods and dietary supplements are taken in the recommended amounts to induce significant effects
this report addresses the current controversy about possible health hazards of dietary tuans fatty acid isomers which are created during hydrogenation of unsaturated fats to change their textural properties and melting points estimates of intakes are approximations based on limited data and problematic analytic techniques major contributors in the diet are fried and baked foods and margarine in which partially hydrogenated vegetable oils may replace fat sources richer in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol consumption of trans fatty acids in the united states has been relatively constant and new food technologies are yielding decreases in the trans fatty acid content of commercially prepared foods when intake of trans fatty acids as hydrogenated fat is compared with that of saturated fat total and lowdensitylipoprotein ldlcholesterol concentrations in blood are lower but both trans fats and saturated fats increase total and ldl concentrations when compared with cis fatty acids or native unhydrogenated fat epidemiologic data are conflicting with respect to cardiovascular disease outcomes we cannot conclude that the intake of trans fatty acids is a risk factor for coronary heart disease nor can we expect that substituting trans for ciacontaining fats will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease few rigorous studies have dealt with biomedical effects of trans fatty acids and possible mechanisms relevant to human health and diseases the nutrition labeling issue is unresolved the options recommendations and research suggestions in this report should outline for nutrition scientists the database needed before any new dietary recommendations or changes in nutrition policy concerning trans fatty acids can be made the debate about trans fatty acids should not detract from dietary recommendations to limit the intake of saturated fat and total fat
trans fatty acids tfa are products of partial hydrogenation industrial process consequently the main source of tfa in the diet has been margarine sweet cookies snacks and fast food it has been suggested that children development may be retarded due to tfa impairment of the essential fatty acid metabolism some evidences also suggests a positive correlation between tfa intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease cvd given the high prevalence of cvd in mexico it is important to promote that good nutrition begins in infancy due to cvd it is believed that tfa consumption developed countries has decreased in mexico there are no current data on the amount of tfa intake in children and teenagers but it is believed that the increase in snacks consumption is a source of tfa high levels in these groups hence there is a need to studies in mexico
the health risks associated with consumption of diets high in trans fats from industrially produced hydrogenated fats are well documented however trans fatty acids are not a homogeneous group of molecules and less is known about the health effects of consuming diets containing vaccenic acid va a positional and geometric isomer of oleic acid the predominant trans isomer in ruminant fats the presence of va in industrial trans fats has raised the question of whether va produces the same adverse health effects as industrially produced trans fats va is also the major trans fat in ruminant fats and questions have arisen as to whether consuming this trans fat has the same effects on health risk the purpose of this paper is to critically review the published studies in humans animals and cell lines epidemiological but not rodent studies suggest that va intake or serum concentrations may be associated with increased cancer risk however epidemiological clinical and rodent studies to date have not demonstrated a relationship with heart or cardiovascular disease insulin resistance or inflammation va is the only known dietary precursor of c9 t11 conjugated linoleic acid cla but recent data suggest that consumption of this trans fat may impart health benefits beyond those associated with cla
hydrogenated oils tend to have a higher trans fatty acid tfa content than oils that do not contain hydrogenated fats prospective epidemiological and casecontrol studies support a major role of tfas in the risk of cardiovascular disease in the partially hydrogenated soybean oil which is the major source of tfas worldwide the main isomer is trans10 c181 in the european countries with the highest tfa intake the netherlands and norway consumption of partially hydrogenated fish oils was common until the mid1990s after which they were omitted from the dietary fat intake these partially hydrogenated fish oils included a variety of very longchain tfas recent findings from asian countries india and iran have indicated a very high intake of tfas from partially hydrogenated soybean oil 4  of energy thus tfas appear to be a particular problem in developing countries where soybean oil is used in 2003 the united states food and drug administration issued a final ruling that required food manufacturers to list the tfas in their foods on the nutritional facts label one way to produce zero levels of tfas is the transesterification reaction between vegetable oils and solid fatty acids like c80 c120 c140 and c160

the effect of various feeding regimes used in agricultural practice in the netherlands on the composition of bovine milkfat with an emphasis on conjugated linoleic acid cla was studied using gas chromatography the composition of bovine milkfat in farm sampling trials during various periods of the year was determined pasture feeding august 1998 and september 1999 barn feeding april 1999 and the transition period may 1999 in addition the effect of the various types of silage included in winter diets on the composition of the milkfat was examined in this latter experiment three groups were selected from an actual situation in dutch agricultural practice herds fed on a diet with grass silage herds fed on a diet with maize silage and herds fed on a diet with both grass and maize silage a clear seasonal effect on the cla content of the milkfat was observed the cla content was highest 073 and 076 mol during pasture feeding and lowest 034 mol during barn feeding winter in the transition period an intermediate cla content was found 052 mol in the second study the remarkable effect of the type of silage on the level of cla in bovine milkfat was observed when a mixture of grass and maize silage was fed the amount of cla 025 mol was lower than when either grass 038 mol or maize silage 035 mol was fed this study indicates that it is possible to influence the level of cla during the period of barn feeding by changing the type of silage that is fed
butter lipids are an important traditional source of dietary energy intake in the form of fat butter lost a sizable portion of its market share due to controversies associated with its cholesterol content and high percentage of longchain saturated fatty acids accordingly the use of vegetable oils and their chemically manipulated counterparts such as those produced by partial hydrogenation or interestrification increased proportionally however beginning in 1940 researchers developed several procedures such as temperaturecontrolled crystallization refractionation of crystallized butter oil solids and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction to improve the acceptance of butter oil others proposed preparation of synthetic substitutes such as sucrose polyesters to reduce intestinal absorption of fatty acids thus reducing caloric intake with concomitant reduction in serum cholesterol the present review provides a summary of the efforts of several attempts to improve the acceptability of butter together with the anticipated epidemiological consequences of longterm consumption of altered butter oil to mammalian health

a new strain of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens th1 that has high potential to produce conjugated linoleic acid cla was isolated strain th1 had higher la isomerase lai activity and was much more tolerant to linoleic acid la than other strains examined however high cla reductase clar activity resulted in the temporary accumulation of cla and subsequent conversion to transvaccenic acid tva when la was added to growing th1 cultures in a solution with dimethylsulfoxide ladmso cla produced was greater than when la was added in a mixture with bovine serum albumin bsa the number of viable cells decreased upon addition of ladmso but then increased as the cla decreased upon its conversion to tva this result suggests that b fibrisolvens can resume growing by the removal of cla from the cells most cla was released from b fibrisolvens cells by gentle washing with bsa suggesting that cla bound to the cells might be removed in the rumen and large intestine thus cla production by b fibrisolvens in the digestive tract could be increased by a reduction in clar activity without accompanying an overall decrease in the cell number of b fibrisolvens fatty acids fas with 18 carbon backbone inducted lai activity whereas unsaturated fas induced clar activity suggesting that fas stimulate the synthesis of lai and clar providing a diet with a low ratio of unsaturated to saturated fas may favor cla production
production of conjugated linoleic acid cla by the intestinal bacteria of dogs and cats was demonstrated by incubating their feces with linoleic acid la cla accumulated once and then decreased with time the numbers of lahydrogenating bacteria in the intestines appeared to decrease greatly with the ages of dogs and cats as a major product of la biohydrogenation transvaccenic acid tva was identified most cla and tva were readily solubilized by shaking the incubation mixture with bovine serum albumin which strongly supports the presumption that cla and tva are mostly formed on the outer surface of cell membrane or excreted to the outer cell surface this result suggests that cla and tva can readily be absorbed through the large intestines triacylglycerol and phospholipid were shown to be hydrolyzed to free fatty acids by fecal bacteria which is critical for biohydrogenation to occur because esterified la is not hydrogenated however since the ability of intestinal bacteria to produce cla is probably low it is desirable to augment cla production

coronary heart disease is becoming a worldwide epidemic and diet and lifestyle are well known contributing factors identifying the kinds of foods that may have a cardioprotective or cardiotoxic effect and understanding their molecular mechanisms of action has become of increasing importance through largely epidemiological evidence trans fatty acid tfa intake has been associated with a variety of cardiovascular complications including atherosclerosis traditionally industrial tfas itfas have been associated with these deleterious cardiovascular effects however there is a current body of research that suggests that ruminant trans fats rtfas may have a cardioprotective role within the heart the molecular mechanisms whereby tfas are delivering their effects are largely unknown in the following review we discuss recent in vitro animal and epidemiological research to better understand the effect of tfas in the diet on cardiovascular disease particularly atherosclerosis

n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids n3pufa of marine origin have been shown to be essential for brain development and cognitive function in addition to their essentiality the scientific literature is full of evidence to suggest that regular consumption andor dietary supplementation with long chain n3pufa give several health benefits including prevention of cardiovascular diseases inflammatory diseases dyslexia and depression long chain n3pufa intake in the western countries including australia has been shown to be inadequate this is largely due to the fact that the western populations do not eat seafood on a regular basis because of its cost and availability and many individuals do not like the flavortasteodor of seafood foods fortified with long chain n3pufa could play an important role in meeting the demands for optimal health marine n3pufa are not likely to compete with saturated monounsaturated and n6pufa as a major source of dietary fat however increasing the intake of foods containing marine n3pufa is an important strategy for the prevention of chronic illnesses recent developments in food technology allow fortification of foods such as bread dairy products eggs pasta biscuits margarines and other spreads without the undesirable fish odortaste and with reasonable shelf life there is a need to increase the amount of long chain n3pufa consumed per serve and optimize their bioavailability this article reviews the foods fortified with marine n3pufa and their role in meeting daily requirements and highlights the need for further research in this important area of functional foods
we compared fatty acid amounts in adipose tissue with fatty acid intake calculated from 2 separate weeks of diet recording and two foodfrequency questionnaires for 140 participants in the nurses health study our results showed that the amounts of polyunsaturated and trans fatty acids in adipose tissue reflect dietary intake and confirm those of previous studies the correlation between the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of adipose tissue and polyunsaturated fatty acid intake from the average of the two foodfrequency questionnaires was 040 this correlation for trans fatty acids was also 040 linolenic acid amounts in adipose tissue were also moderately correlated with intake from the average of the foodfrequency questionnaires r  034 an estimate of trans fatty acid intake from vegetable sources correlated much more strongly with adipose trans fatty acids than did an estimate of trans fatty acids from animal sources adipose tissue aspirates can be used to indicate intake of exogenous fatty acids
studies were conducted in rabbits and rats to investigate the effects of diets rich in oleic cis diet palmitic sat diet and trans fatty acids trans diet on plasma lipids and lipoprotein metabolism an important difference between these species is that rabbits possess plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein cetp activity while rats are devoid of transfer activity in the presence of dietary cholesterol 02 ww the change in plasma low density lipoproteincholesterol ldlc concentration from baseline was significantly higher in rabbits fed the trans diet compared with those fed the cis diet p  001 despite this difference the hepatic ldlreceptor activity was similar in all groups also the fatty acid composition of hepatic phospholipids was affected by diet with lower proportion of palmitic 11 and higher 19 linoleic acid despite a similar content in the diet these effects may represent the maintenance of membrane fluidity within narrow limits to ensure optimal function the studies in rats showed that the plasma total cholesterol concentration was 20 lower p  001 in transfed rats compared with those fed the cis diet the results of an in vivo assay of reverse cholesterol transport rct suggested that the three diets gave rise to high density lipoprotein hdl particles with similar capacity to accept cellular cholesterol the differential effects of dietary trans fatty acids in these animal models provide another line of evidence that reinforces the significant role of cetp activity in determining the distribution of plasma cholesterol in response to dietary trans fatty acids
this study was designed to investigate the effects of oleic cis palmitic sat and trans fatty acids trans on cholesterol metabolism rats fed the trans diet had lower plasma total cholesterol p  0005 and nonhdlcholesterol non hdlc concentrations p  0005 compared with their cisfed counterparts plasma hdlc was highest in rats fed the sat diet p  001 an in vivo assay of reverse cholesterol transport rct was performed whereby radiolabeled cholesterol was delivered to the liver as acetylated ldl and the reappearance of label into plasma and hdl was determined plasma radioactivity in transfed rats was lower than in their satfed counterparts p  001 and consistent with the cholesterol distribution in plasma the difference was due to lower h3cholesterol in lower density lipoproteins despite dietinduced differences in the cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations and fatty acid composition of hdl the amount of label in hdl did not differ among groups suggesting that consumption of these diets resulted in hdl populations with similar capacity to participate in rct the present findings suggest that dietary trans fatty acids regulate the metabolism of apolipoprotein bcontaining lipoproteins in rats and that the effect may be masked in species possessing high plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein cetp activity these results reinforce the important role of cetp activity in determining the distribution of plasma cholesterol in response to dietary trans fatty acids
background the consumption of trans fatty acids adversely affects fasting plasma lipoprotein concentrations objective this study aimed to investigate whether postprandial lipoprotein metabolism is affected by the consumption of trans fatty acids design in a randomized crossover study 19 healthy men consumed fatty meals that were identical except that 10 of energy was provided as trans 181 acids in the trans meal and as oleic acid in the cis meal results the meals induced similar responses in plasma lipids cholesteryl ester transfer cet was activated after consumption of both meals p  00001 however it was 28 higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal 280 129 compared with 219  116 nmol cholesteryl esterml plasma  6 h time x diet interaction p  00001 plasma apolipoproteina apoa concentrations remained constant however triacylglycerolrich lipoproteins formed 4 h after ingestion of the trans meal contained a higher concentration of apoa than did those formed after ingestion of the cis meal 489  66 compared with 396  54 ul p  002 the change in cet and in the proportion of plasma apoa in the triacylglycerolrich lipoprotein fractions correlated with indexes of alimentary lipemia conclusions consumption of meals high in trans fatty acids results in higher cet and postprandial lipoprotein concentrations enriched in apoa than does consumption of meals free of trans fatty acids this study highlights the importance of doublebond configuration in determining postprandial lipoprotein composition

public health recommendations for the us population in 1977 were to reduce fat intake to as low as 30 of calories to lower the incidence of coronary artery disease these recommendations resulted in a compositional shift in food materials throughout the agricultural industry and the fractional content of fats was replaced principally with carbohydrates subsequently highcarbohydrate diets were recognized as contributing to the lipoprotein pattern that characterizes atherogenic dyslipidemia and hypertriacylglycerolemia the rising incidences of metabolic syndrome and obesity are becoming commonihemes in the literature current recommendations are to keep saturated fatty acid trans fatty acid and cholesterol intakes as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet in the face of such recommendations the agricultural industry is shifting food composition toward lower proportions of all saturated fatty acids to date no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified this review summarizes research findings and observations on the disparate functions of saturated fatty acids and seeks to bring a more quantitative balance to the debate on dietary saturated fat whether a finite quantity of specific dietary saturated fatty acids actually benefits health is not yet known because agricultural practices to reduce saturated fat will require a prolonged and concerted effort and because the world is moving toward more individualized dietary recommendations should the steps to decrease saturated fatty acids to as low as agriculturally possible not wait until evidence clearly indicates which amounts and types of saturated fatty acids are optimal

rapeseeds are naturally rich in cardioprotective micronutrients but refining leads to substantial losses or the production of undesirable compounds the optimoils european project proposed innovative refining conditions to produce an optimized rapeseed oil enriched in micronutrients and low in trans linolenic acid we aimed to investigate cardioprotective properties of this optimized oil in a randomized doubleblind controlled crossover study 59 healthy normolipidaemic men consumed either optimized or standard rapeseed oils 20 gd and margarines 22 gd for 3 weeks the optimized oil reduced the trans fa concentration p  0009 and increased the contents of alphatocopherol p  0022 and coenzyme q10 p0001 in comparison with the standard oil over the 3week trial totalhdlcholesterol and ldlhdlcholesterol were increased by 4 p005 with the standard oil consumption whereas none of them rose with the optimized rapeseed oil which increased the hdlcholesterol and apoa1 plasma content  2 ns and 3 p005 respectively the effects observed on the plasma hdlcholesterol levels p  0059 the totalhdlcholesterol ratio p  0092 and on the apoa1 concentrations p  0060 suggest an improvement of the cholesterol profile with the optimized rapeseed oil finally the optimized oil reduced the plasma content of ldlox 6 ns this effect being significantly different from the standard oil p  0050 in conclusion reasonable intake of an optimized rapeseed oil resulting from innovative refining processes and enriched in cardioprotective micronutrients represent a relevant nutritional approach to prevent the risk of cardiovascular diseases by improving the cholesterol profile and reducing ldl oxidation c 2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
numerous micronutrients naturally abundant in oilseeds prevent the risk of cardiovascular diseases by reducing cholesterolemia and oxidative stress these micronutrients include phytosterols and various antioxidants such as polyphenols tocopherols and coenzyme q10q9 but most of them are lost during the oilseed oil refining the main objective of the optimoil project was to modify the processes of oil refining in order to reduce the lost of micronutrients two clinical trials crossover monocentric randomized doubleblind and controlled were designed to investigate the effect of an optimized rapeseed oil 1 on cardiovascular biomarkers longterm study and 2 on oxidative stress parameters postprandial study for the longterm study 59 volunteers ingested daily 20 g of oil and 22 g of margarine optimized or standard for 2 periods of 3 weeks separated by a 3week washout period blood samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of each period for the postprandial study a subgroup of 16 volunteers came fasted at the laboratory and took 300 ml of a test meal containing 60 of the optimized or standard oils blood samples were collected before and during 6 h after the test meal intake in comparison with the standard oil and margarine the optimized oil and margarine exhibit as expected an increased content of phytosterol  22 polyphenols x11 tocopherols  131 and coenzyme q10q9   165 overall conditions of this study were relevant to investigate the effect of the optimized rapeseed oil and margarine on the cardiovascular risk and the oxidative stress c 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the fulani are seminomadic pastoralists of west africa whose diet culture and economy are centred on cattle previous studies have shown that the fulani of northern nigeria derive 50 of their total calories from fat and 30 of their calories from milk cheese yogurt and butter oil that contain significant amounts of trans fatty acids tfas primarily vaccenic acid which raise total serum cholesterol and lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol ldlc and lower highdensity lipoproteincholesterol hdlc the study was conducted to know how the consumption of relatively large amounts of dairy products by adult fulani affected the tfa content of their serum phospholipids blood samples were collected from 22 male and 29 female fulani aged 3560 years who were living in rural areas of gombe state in northeastern nigeria the total serum phospholipid fraction was isolated and its fatty acid composition was determined surprisingly vaccenic acid was not detected and three other tfas181t6 181t9 and 182t9t12together accounted for only 016 of the total fatty acid the mean serum total cholesterol ldlc and triglyceride concentrations of the subjects were within the normal range for populations in developed countries however at 32 mgdl the mean serum hdlc concentration of the fulani males was slightly below the lower limit of the reference range no correlations were observed between the total tfa percentage or that of the three individual tfas and any of the parameters of the serum lipid profile these findings indicate that with respect to tfas at least the fatty acid pattern of the serum phospholipids of fulani pastoralists does not reflect the high tfa content of their traditional diet despite the consumption of rumenic acidrich dairy products for unknown reasons the seminomadic fulani manage to maintain a low level of tfas in their blood and a relatively healthful serum lipid profile while the mechanism that accounts for this disconnect between the consumption of tfas by fulani pastoralists and the proportion of tfas in their serum phospholipids is obscure possibilities include discrimination against nimenic acid during the process of triglyceride synthesis and chylomicron synthesis in the intestine and the preferential oxidation of tfas by fulani the people compared to other ethnic groups
background trans fatty acids tfas and conjugated linoleic acids clas are present in dairy products and human milk and can have detrimental and beneficial effects in humans the content of tfas and clas in milk is determined largely by the diet of the mother methods we compared the proportions of tfas and clas in the milk of rural fulani in northern nigeria who consume dairy products to that of women living in an urban center who consume little in the way of dairy products lactating fulani women n41 and women residing in the city of jos nigeria n41 were recruited into the study we predicted that the milk of the fulani pastoralists would contain higher amounts of tfas and clas compared to their urban counterparts results the mean total tfa proportions for the fulani and urban women were 022 and 034 respectively and were not significantly different the percentages of clas in milk fat were not different between rural and urban women 016 vs 014 these tfa and cla values were 4 to 10fold lower than for milk of women elsewhere in the world conclusions the percentages of tfas and clas in milk were not different between rural and urban dwellers in northern nigeria whose diets differ greatly in the amounts of dairy products they contain however the fact that the percentages of tfas and clas in the milk of nigerian women were much lower than the percentages reported from other parts of the world may have implications for the longterm growth and development of infants in the northern nigeria and elsewhere in the western sahel c 2006 elsevier bv all rights reserved
the effects of some commonly consumed oils on plasma lipids lipid peroxidation and thromboxane a2 txa2 production in chicks were studied a total of 150 1dayold chicks were divided into 5 groups and selected as butter margarine sunflower oil olive oil and corn oil groups the oils were added to their chow as 5 ww at the beginning and 7 at the end after a period of 45 days blood samples were obtained from the vena axillaris then plasma levels of total cholesterol hdlc hdl2c hdsc ldlc thiobarbutiric acid reactive substrates tbars as malondialdehyde mda and txa2 were measured the results indicated that total cholesterol hdlc hdl3c and txa2 levels were highest in the butter group whereas hdl2c was highest in the olive oil group the lowest hdl2c was in the margarine group and the second lowest level was in the butter group tears levels were highest in the corn oil group lowest in the butter group and increased in the order buttermargarineolive oilsunflower oilcorn oil our findings show that unsaturated fats added to the chow of chicks are more peroxidated in their blood than saturated ones the effect of this peroxidation on the meat of chicks and on those who eat them is not known on the other hand in spite of the fact that the metabolism of lipids lipoproteins and txa2 might be somewhat different from those in humans these findings can be regarded as a guide for humans it may be speculated that although unsaturated fats do not contain cholesterol they constitute a risk factor for many diseases including atherosclerosis due to their low resistance to lipid peroxidation on the other hand although saturated fats constitute a risk factor for atherosclerosis due to their high cholesterol and saturated fatty acids contents they are beneficial for humans due to their high resistance to lipid peroxidation therefore in evaluating the consumption of fats these 2 points must be taken into account in addition olive oil is the most resistant oil to lipid peroxidation among unsaturated oils and the low level of hdl2c in the margarine group is interesting with respect to atherosclerosis also our unexpected finding which shows that txa2 production is higher in animals fed saturated fats than in those fed unsaturated ones needs to be investigated
to support labeling claims and authenticity of food products industry needs reliable methods for the analysis of fatty acids including trans fatty acids tfa in finished products precise quantification of tfa can be problematic due to the occurrence of various positional and geometrical isomers originating from different sources such as animal fats or processed vegetable oils and fats the risk of underestimating tfa amounts is particularly high when inappropriate gc conditions are used complex sample preparation procedures involving purification of tfa isomers by silver ion chromatography have been welldocumented and used for research purposes however in the food industry time and cost constraints do not permit multiple analytical steps therefore streamlined methods are necessary direct methods include preparation of fatty acid methyl esters directly from food samples without prior extraction the appropriate resolution is obtained using highresolution gc with a highly polar 100 m capillary column and quantification is achieved using experimentally determined response we found that it is possible to quantify tfa in the range of 001 to 500 g100 g of lipids in a wide range of food products in addition the use of direct transmethylation response factors and highresolution gc allow accurate quantification of other fatty acids including polyunsaturated and longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids

backgroundobjectives dietary pattern studies are traditionally the domain of epidemiological research from a clinical perspective there is a need to explore the effects of changing food and dietary patterns of individuals the aim was to identify patterns of food choice in the context of a clinical weight loss trial cluster analysis based on reported serves of food groups revealed dietary patterns informative for the clinical setting subjectsmethods cluster analysis was conducted using diet history data from two clinical trials at baseline and outcomes at 3 months were reviewed based on these clusters n  231 the cluster solution was analysed using defined food groups in serves and with respect to clinical parameters and requirements for selected nutrients results two distinct dietary patterns were identified from the reported baseline dietary intakes subjects in cluster 1 reported food patterns characterised by higher intakes of lowfat dairy and unsaturated oils and margarine and were generally more closely aligned to food choices encouraged in national dietary guidelines subjects in cluster 2 reported a dietary pattern characterised by noncore foods and drinks higherand mediumfat dairy foods fatty meats and alcohol at 3 months cluster 2 subjects reported greater reductions in energy intake 5317 kj p0001 and greater weight loss 56 kg p005 compared with cluster 1 conclusions overweight subjects with reported dietary patterns similar to dietary guidelines at baseline may have more difficulty in reducing energy intake than those with poor dietary patterns correcting exposure to noncore foods and drinks was key to successful weight loss european journal of clinical nutrition 2013 67 330336 doi101038ejcn201326 published online 13 february 2013
in this paper a comprehensive review of transfatty acid levels reported in different types of food products is offered the lowest levels are found in some types of bread 01 while the highest levels up to 40 are found in fried potatoes some foods like shortenings cakes and pastries may have up to 30 of these fatty acids in milk and dairy products the reported levels are between 150 and 520 in meat and derived products between 020 and 2130 in chocolates from 0 to 15 70 the greatest variability is found in margarines where a variety has been reported from transfree products to products containing up to 3430 in relation to the transfatty acid profile 181t is the most abundant fatty acid found in the majority of foods followed by c182t c183t c181t y c141t due to the negative health effects of these fatty acids there is a trend to reduce their levels in food products and to include them in the nutritional label of food packaging
hydrogenation of oils and diary products of ruminant animals leads to an increasing amount of trans fatty acids in the human diet trans fatty acids are incorporated in several lipids and accumulate in the membrane of cells here we systematically investigate whether the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein app is affected by trans fatty acids compared to the cis conformation our experiments clearly show that trans fatty acids compared to cis fatty acids increase amyloidogenic and decrease nonamyloidogenic processing of app resulting in an increased production of amyloid beta a beta peptides main components of senile plaques which are a characteristic neuropathological hallmark for alzheimers disease ad moreover our results show that oligomerization and aggregation of a beta are increased by trans fatty acids the mechanisms identified by this in vitro study suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids potentially increases the ad risk or causes an earlier onset of the disease c 2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved

gupta a and n b bowden 2013 separation of cisfatty acids from saturated and transfatty acids by nanoporous polydicyclopentadiene membranes acs applied materials  interfaces 53 924933
this article describes the separation of mixtures of fatty acid salts using a new organic solvent nanofiltration membrane based on polydicyclopentadiene pdcpd mixtures of free fatty acids could not be separated by the membranes because they permeated at similar rates when triisobutylamine was added to the fatty acids the cisfatty acid salts oleic petroselinic vaccenic linoleic and linolenic acid had slower permeation though the membranes than saturated stearic acid and transfatty acid elaidic acid salts the reason for the difference in permeation was due to the formation of stable salt pairs between the amine and fatty acids that increased their crosssectional areas the fatty acid salts derived from saturated and transfatty acids were smaller than the critical area cutoff for the pdcpd membranes so they readily permeated in contrast the fatty acid salts derived from the cisfatty acids had critical areas larger than critical area cutoff of the pdpcd membranes and had slowed permeation the partitioning coefficients of fatty acids and fatty acid salts were investigated to demonstrate that they were not responsible for the difference in permeation the use of pressure was investigated to greatly accelerate the permeation through the membranes for a solvent mixture of 3565 vv toluenehexanes the permeation of solvent was approximately 39 l m2 h1 this value is similar to values reported for permeation through membranes used in industry the separation of a mixture of fatty acids based on the composition of soybean oil was investigated using pressure the saturated fatty acid salts were almost completely removed from the cisfatty acid salts when ibu3n was used as the amine to form the salt pairs the separation of the cisfatty acids found in soybean oil was investigated with pr3n as the amine the oleic acid salt oleic acid has one cis double bond preferentially permeated the membrane while the linoleic two cis double bonds and linolenic three cis double bonds salts were partly retained the separation of fatty acids using membranes may have real applications in industry to purify fatty acids on a large scale
the cholesterollowering effect of plant sterols was first discovered in the early 1950s however it is only recently that plant sterols have become clinically important when advances in foodtechnology have made it possible to combine sterols with a variety of food products including margarines yogurts fruit juices and cereal bars we review the clinical trial evidence of lipidlowering efficacy of plant sterols and discuss their implications in routine clinical practice to generate the evidence we searched the pubmed database for english language literature using relevant keywords and medical subject heading mesh terms and extracted the findings from recently published studies and metaanalyses on this topic our findings suggest that the shortterm use of food supplements rich in plant sterols is a safe and effective strategy to maximize the benefits of dietary and lifestyle therapy either with or without statin therapy among majority of dyslipidemic patients with need for additional lipidlowering
background the consumption of high levels of industrial trans fatty acids tfa has been related to cardiovascular disease diabetes and sudden cardiac death but the causal mechanisms are not well known in this study nmr and lcms untargeted metabolomics has been used as an approach to explore the impact of tfa intake on plasma metabolites methodologyprincipal findings in a doubleblinded randomized controlled parallelgroup study 52 overweight postmenopausal women received either partially hydrogenated soybean oil providing 157 gday of tfa trans18 1 or control oil with mainly oleic acid for 16 weeks subsequent to the intervention period the subjects participated in a 12week dietary weight loss program before and after the tfa intervention and after the weight loss programme volunteers participated in an oral glucose tolerance test plsda revealed elevated lipid profiles with tfa intake nmr indicated upregulated ldl cholesterol levels and unsaturation lcms profiles demonstrated elevated levels of specific polyunsaturated pufa longchain phosphatidylcholines pcs and a sphingomyelin sm which were confirmed with a lipidomics based method plasma levels of these markers of tfa intake declined to their low baseline levels after the weight loss program for the tfa group and did not fluctuate for the control group the marker levels were unaffected by ogtt conclusionssignificance this study demonstrates that intake of tfa affects phospholipid metabolism the preferential integration of trans18 1 into the sn1 position of pcs all containing pufa in the sn2 position could be explained by a general upregulation in the formation of longchain pufas after tfa intake andor by specific mobilisation of these fats into pcs nmr supported these findings by revealing increased unsaturation of plasma lipids in the tfa group these specific changes in membrane lipid species may be related to the mechanisms of tfainduced disease but need further validation as risk markers

the present work was undertaken to study the metabolism of fatty acids with trans double bonds by rat hepatocytes in liver mitochondria elaidoylcoa was a poorer substrate for carnitine palmitoyltransferase i cpti than oleoylcoa likewise incubation of hepatocytes with oleic acid produced a more pronounced stimulation of cpti than incubation with trans fatty acids this was not due to a differential effect of cis and trans fatty acids on acetylcoa carboxylase acc activity and malonylcoa levels elaidic acid was metabolized by hepatocytes at a higher rate than oleic acid surprisingly compared to oleic acid elaidic acid was a better substrate for mitochondrial and especially peroxisomal oxidation but a poorer substrate for cellular and very low density lipoprotein triacylglycerol synthesis results thus show that trans fatty acids are preferentially oxidized by hepatic peroxisomes and that the accmalonylcoacpti system for coordinate control of fatty acid metabolism is not responsible for the distinct hepatic utilization of cis and trans fatty acids

baseline cholesterol metabolism was hypothesized to regulate responses of cholesterol synthesis and absorption and serum cholesterol lowering to hypolipidaemic treatment thus serum cholesterol and noncholesterol sterols were measured before and during longterm simvastatin treatment inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and subsequent combination of statin with plant stanol ester margarine inhibition of cholesterol absorption consumption in subjects with low n  15 and high n  15 absorption of cholesterol defined by respective love and high baseline ratios of serum cholestanol to cholesterol cholesterol synthesis defined by precursors of cholesterol was markedly reduced by the longterm statin treatment in both groups but more extensively in the low than high absorption group p  005 yet the respective serum cholesterol reductions were similar from among the absorption markers sitosterol and cholestanol ratios were correspondingly increased more in the love than in the high absorption group plant stanol ester margarine consumption combined with chronic statin treatment further lowered the serum cholesterol level p  0001 only in the high absorption group the sum of cholesterol absorption markers was reduced more p  005 in the high than in the low absorption group while the nonsignificant serum cholesterol reduction of the low absorption group was associated with relatively high increase of cholesterol synthesis thus stanol ester margarine combined with chronic simvastatin treatment reduces cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol more consistently in subjects with high than love baseline absorption of cholesterol the profile of baseline cholesterol metabolism determines the changes in synthesis and absorption of cholesterol to hypolipidaemic treatments but affects less differently serum cholesterol level c 2002 elsevier science ireland ltd all rights reserved

background and aims recent largescale trials have consistently documented the fact that a 2535 reduction in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc can delay the progression of atherosclerosis this raises the question as to how much it is possible to reduce serum cholesterol using feasible therapies the aim of this study was to investigate the cholesterollowering efficacy of a triple therapy combining bile acid malabsorption with the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and absorption methods and results eleven consecutive hypercholes terolemic coronary patients from lipid clinics on a lowfat lowcholesterol baseline diet added simvastatin 20 mgday for three months and then dietary plant stanol ester margarine 225 g of stanolsday for eight weeks finally cholestyramine 8 gday was added for another eight weeks this was a beforeafter trial in which the results of each period were compared with baseline and those of the previous period serum lipids were quantitated using commercial kits and serum sterols by means of gasliquid chromatography simvastatin lowered ldlc by 39 p0001 and additional stanol ester margarine by a further 13 p005 the triple treatment led to 67 reduction from baseline p0001 with all ldlc values being 26 mmoll and increased highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc by 15 p001 it also increased the serum lathosterocholesterol ratio p001 thus indicating an upregulation of cholesterol synthesis and increased the serum sitosterol ratio p001 despite the simultaneous consumption of plant stanols conclusions the massive reduction in ldl and increase in hdlc obtained using our triple therapy suggests that the combination of stanol ester with only moderate doses of statin and resin makes it possible to control ldlc levels effectively in hypercholesterolemic subjects

phytosterols are plant sterols mainly campesterol and sitosterol and their respective stanols 5 alphasaturated derivatives which chemically resemble cholesterol they are present in a normal diet and are absorbed proportionally to cholesterol but to a much lesser extent such that less than 01 of serum sterols are plant sterols phytosterols inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption and fatsoluble plant stanol esters were introduced as a functional food for lowering serum cholesterol in the early 1990s plant sterol esters entered the market at the end of the 1990s inhibition of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol stimulates cholesterol synthesis a factor which limits serum cholesterol lowering to about 10 with phytosterols enrichment of the diet with plant stanol esters reduces absorption and serum concentrations of both cholesterol and plant sterols whereas enrichment of the diet with plant sterol esters especially in combination with statins lowers serum cholesterol but increases serum plant sterol levels recent studies have suggested that highserum plant sterol levels may be associated with increased coincidence of coronary heart disease estimates of coronary heart disease reduction by 2025 with plant sterolsstanols is based mainly on shortterm studies longterm cholesterol lowering needed for the prevention of coronary heart disease may be successful with plant stanol esters which lower serum cholesterol in both genders over at least a year

background reduction of serum cholesterol decreases mortality in primary and especially in secondary prevention we investigated how effectively postmenopausal women with a previous myocardial infarction reduced their serum cholesterol with dietary means by using sitostanol ester rapeseed oil margarine alone and in combination with statins and to what extent cholesterol metabolism was affected methods and results the first study group consisted of 22 randomly chosen women with angiographically documented coronary artery disease baseline studies on home diet were followed by doubleblind randomized crossover studies on margazine without and with sitostanol 3 gd ester for 7 weeks in random order a second group of 10 women on simvastatin consumed sitostanol ester margarine for 12 weeks sitostanol ester margarine lowered serum total cholesterol by 13 p05 and ldl cholesterol by 20 p01 sitostanol ester margarine reduced total cholesterol in all patients ldl cholesterol 26 mmoll 100 mgdl in 32 and 34 mmoll 133 mgdl in 73 versus none and 270c during the home diet p01 for both combined with simvastatin sitostanol still reduced total and ldl cholesterol by 113 and 165 p01 for both sitostanol reduced absorption 45 increased fecal elimination 45 as neutral sterols and stimulated synthesis 39 of cholesterol high cholestanol and plant sterol high cholesterol absorption and low baseline precursor sterol proportions low cholesterol synthesis predicted high decreases in serum cholesterol conclusions dietary use of sitostanol ester margarine normalizes ldl cholesterol in about one third of women with previous myocardial infarction especially in those with high baseline absorption and low synthesis of cholesterol and in combination with statins reduces the needed drug dose
objective especially in women serum cholesterol lowering with cholesterol malabsorption using plant sterol ester margarine has revealed controversial results accordingly in this retrospective study we evaluated whether plant stanol 3 gd ester margarine consumption for 6 and 12 weeks lowers serum cholesterol levels in mildly hypercholesterolemic women without n  38 and with n  22 coronary heart disease design the study population was selected from two of our earlier studies correspondingly matched for age body mass index and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in addition the longterm effect 12 months of plant stanol ester with a dose reduction after 6 months from 3 to 2 g stanold was studied in the noncoronary group results at baseline the coronary and noncoronary groups had similar serum lathosterol synthesis marker and campesterol and sitosterol absorption markers ratios to cholesterol but highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol was lower and serum squalene and desmosterol ratios to cholesterol were significantly higher in the coronary versus noncoronary groups shortterm plant stanol ester consumption reduced serum cholesterol by 87 p  0001 in the coronary group from the control margarine period and in the noncoronary group by 11 from the control group p  0001 the cholesterollowering effect sustained unchanged in the noncoronary subjects during 1 year consumption despite reduction of the plant stanol intake from 3 gd to 2 gd conclusion plant stanol ester margarine consumption effectively reduced serum cholesterol in postmenopausal women with and without coronary artery disease in shortterm and for at least 1 year in the noncoronary group suggesting that stanol ester margarine might be used in the long term for cholesterol lowering in women
in familial hypercholesterolemia fh the lowering of serum cholesterol levels should be started in childhood in order to prevent coronary artery disease later in life however treatment of children is problematic we studied the effects of sitostanol 3 gday ester dissolved in rapeseed oil margarine as a hypocholesterolemic agent in one homozygous and 14 heterozygous children with fh maintained on a low cholesterol diet for 6 weeks using a doubleblind crossover design absorption and synthesis of cholesterol were evaluated by measuring serum plant sterol and cholesterol precursor proportions to cholesterol by gasliquid chromatography the compliance was good and the children could not distinguish by taste the two margarines without and with sitostanol ester sitostanol margarine significantly reduced serum total intermediate density idl and low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol by 11 26 and 15 respectively and increased hdlldl cholesterol ratio by 27 the proportions of serum delta8cholestenol lathosterol and desmosterol were significantly increased by 36 19 and 18 and those of serum cholestanol campesterol and sitosterol were significantly decreased by 9 42 and 29 respectively suggesting that cholesterol absorption was decreased and synthesis was compensatorily increased high basal precursor sterol proportions predicted a high decrease in ldl cholesterol levels in conclusion partial replacement of normal dietary fat consumption by sitostanol ester margarine appears to be an effective and safe hypocholesterolemic treatment in children with fh
this study was set up to determine how panfrying either without culinary fat or with different culinary fats polyunsaturated fatty acids pufaenriched culinary fat olive oil and margarine affects the fatty acid fa composition of pork the meat samples longissimus thoracis lt originated from pigs fed different dietary fat sources animal fat soybean oil or linseed oil and thus had different fa compositions before frying panfrying resulted in considerable increases in the meat totalfa content although this was not always significant and highly variable despite standardisation of the frying process the fa composition of the panfried meat tended to become similar to that of the culinary fat used and the extent of changes in the content of a particular fa was relative to the fa gradient from the culinary fat to the meat however this was also dependent on the culinary fat used since frying in olive oil appeared to affect the fa composition of the meat more than did frying in the other culinary fats differences in fa composition of meat resulting from different animal feeding treatments remained unchanged after panfrying without fat they became smaller after frying in margarine and pufaenriched culinary fat whereas frying in olive oil largely masked the initial fa profile differences long chain pufa lcpufa in the meat were not significantly lost by the frying process but their proportion was influenced by the uptake of the culinary fat c 2006 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
rare sugars are defined as monosaccharides that exist in nature but are only present in limited quantities there are more than 50 kinds of rare sugars while naturally abundant monosaccharides such as dglucose and dfructose are very few in number the rare sugars in a ringform are called an izumoring there are three different izumorings tetroses pentoses and hexoses a scheme was drawn for the production of ketohexoses based upon the network composed of the four groups comprising all of the ketohexoses and hexitols a symmetric izumoring comprising of 16 aldohexoses 8 ketohexoses and 10 hexitols were drawn all the compounds were connected to each other by enzyme reactions or by hydrogenation reactions rare sugars such as of dpsicose showed high antioxidative activity and excellent food properties and were promising as a functional dessert for elderly people furthermore rare sugars have the potential to be used in sweeteners and as food products with new functional characteristics to prevent diabetes arteriosclerosis and obesity by suppression of lipid accumulation and hyperglycemia
the addition of some legume ingredients to bread has been associated with effects on glycaemic insulinaemic and satiety responses that may be beneficial in controlling type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and obesity however the effect of australian sweet lupin lupinus angustifolius flour aslf is unknown this investigation examined the effect of adding aslf to standard white bread on postmeal glycaemic insulinaemic and satiety responses and palatability in healthy subjects using a randomised singleblind crossover design 11 subjects consumed one breakfast of aslf bread and two of standard white bread  7 days apart after fasting overnight each breakfast also included margarine jam and tea with milk and contained 50g available carbohydrate on each test day blood samples were taken after fasting then several times over 2 hours postprandially and analysed for plasma glucose and serum insulin subjects rated breakfast palatability and perception of satiety in the fasting state and over 3 hours postprandially after which food intake from an ad libitum buffet and for the rest of the day was recorded incremental areas under the curves for glucose insulin and satiety glycaemic index insulinaemic index and satiety index were calculated aslf addition to the breakfast reduced its glycaemic index mean  sem aslf bread breakfast  740  96 standard white bread breakfast  100 p0022 raised its insulinaemic index aslf bread breakfast  1277  120 standard white bread breakfast  100 p0046 but did not affect palatability satiety or food intake aslf addition resulted in a palatable breakfast however the potential benefits of the lowered glycaemic index may be eclipsed by the increased insulinaemic index

consumption of diets high in hydrogenated fat trans fatty acids has been shown to have an adverse affect on lipoprotein profiles with respect to cardiovascular disease risk dietary fat and cholesterol play an important role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses shown to be involved in atherogenesis we investigated the effects of diets containing hydrogenated fat on cellular immune response and production of inflammatory cytokines in human subjects with moderately elevated cholesterol levels ldl cholesterol 130 mgdl in a double blind crossover study 19 subjects consumed three diets 30 of calories as fat of which two thirds were provided as soybean oil soybean oilbased stick margarine or butter for 32 days each in a randomized order production of proinflammatory mediators prostaglandin pg e2 interleukin il1beta il6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfalpha delayed type hypersensitivity dth response in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and production of il2 were determined production of il6 and tnfalpha was significantly higher after consumption of stick margarine diet compared with soybean oil diet il1beta and tnfalpha production correlated positively with ratios of total cholesterol to hdl cholesterol r  0499 p  000 1 and r  029 1 p  004 respectively there was no significant difference in dth response lymphocyte proliferation or levels of il2 and pge2 produced among three groups our results indicate that consumption of a diet high in hydrogenated fat does not adversely affect cellular immunity but increases production of inflammatory cytokines that have been associated with the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis
objective in this study we examine trends in dietary intake of transfatty acids from 19801982 to 19951997 using data collected as part of the minnesota heart survey mhs design the mhs is an ongoing observational epidermiologic study among independent crosssectional probability samples of adults twentyfourhour dietary recalls were collected on a subset of participants to obtain transfatty acid intake estimates the dietary recall records were recalculated using the university of minnesota nutrition coordinating center food and nutrient database subjectssetting the survey population included noninstitutionalized adults aged 25 to 74 years residing in the minneapolisst paul mn metropolitan area statistical analysis mean intake estimates were generated for each survey and a generalized linear mixed model was used to test the null hypothesis of no difference in the age adjusted sexspecific means between 19801982 19851987 19901992 and 19951997 results downward trends in dietary intake of transfatty acids were found between 19801982 and 19951997 for example for men mean intake of total transfatty acids declined from 83 g per day in 19801982 to 62 g per day in 19951997 p001 represented as a percentage of energy similar declines were seen with mean intake of total transfatty acids decreasing from 30 of total energy in 19801982 to 22 of total energy in 19951997 p001 applicationsconclusions it seems that intake of transfatty acids is on the decline consideration should be given to additional changes in the food supply and consumer food choices that may result in further reduction in consumption of transfatty acids
objectives this study assessed specific dietary practices and overall physical activity patterns of lakota adults residing on indian reservations in south dakota perceived barriers to changing dietary and physical activity behaviors were also examined design a convenience sample of lakota adults was surveyed data on consumption of higherfat foods fruit and vegetable intake use of sugarsweetened beverages physical activity patterns and barriers to change in diet and physical activity were collected via inperson interviews subjectssetting a total of 219 adults from 2 adjacent reservations in south dakota participated results higherfat foods consumed most frequently included margarine and butter 320 greater than or equal to 5 times per week eggs 301 greater than or equal to 5 times per week whole milk 257 greater than or equal to 5 times per week potato chips corn chips and popcorn 151 greater than or equal to 5 times per week and bacon and sausage 133 greater than or equal to 5 times per week few subjects reported consuming fruit on a daily basis vegetables were consumed somewhat more frequently most subjects reported engaging in mild or moderate physical activities 3 or more times per week although women were found to engage in moderate and strenuous physical activities less frequently than men major barriers to fruit intake included expense 164 quality 142 and availability 132 barriers to vegetable intake mentioned most frequently included availability 114 cost 104 and quality 91 taste was the most frequently mentioned barrier to cutting intake of highfat foods 279 lack of child care 158 lack of time 147 and safety concerns 146 were the most salient barriers to regular exercise applicationsconclusions nutrition interventions are needed that address the major barriers to diet change reported by lakota adults efforts to increase physical activity should focus on lakota women and should address the identified barriers to regular exercise
over the last several years national programs to lower the content of industrially produced ip c181 and c182 trans fatty acids in foods have been implemented but whether this has resulted in lower blood trans fatty acid levels is unknown likewise an increased perception of the health benefits of fish oils rich in epa and dha may have resulted in an increase in consumption and blood levels of these fatty acids to explore these issues we analyzed the changes in rbc fatty acid composition between the 7th 19982001 and 8th 20052007 examination cycles in a random sample of the framingham offspring cohort this was a retrospective cohort study of 291 participants from whom blood was drawn at both examinations and for whom complete covariate data were available overall the proportion of trans fatty acids in rbc changed by 23 95 cl 26 to 21 rbc epadha proportions increased by 41 95 cl 31 to 52 in 38 individuals who were taking fish oil supplements at examination 8 but in 253 participants not taking fish oil the proportion of rbc epadha did not change in conclusion in a random subsample of framingham offspring participants with serial observations over 67 y the proportion of trans fatty acids in rbc decreased those of epadha increased in people taking fish oil supplements these changes could potentially translate into a lower risk for cardiovascular disease j nutr 142 12971303 2012
epidemiological data have shown an association of the intake of industrial produced trans fatty acids tfa and sudden cardiac death the present study examines the impact of elaidic acid t181n9 and linoelaidic acid t182n6 on the human aortic endothelial cell functional response trans fatty acids predominately incorporated into the phospholipid component while only a minute fraction of the total fatty acids fa incorporated into triacylglycerol trans fatty acids incorporated into the plasma membranes at the expense of the saturatedfa stearic palmitic and to a lesser extent myristic acid both t18 1n9 and t18 2n6 induced a proinflammatory response by elevating surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule1 icam1 neither oleic nor linoleic evoked a proinflammatory phenotype under the maximal 50 mu m treatments both tfa and stearic acid increased phosphorylation of the icam1 transcriptional regulator nuclear factorkappa beta nfkappa beta while oleic and linoleic acids did not appear to alter the phosphorylation status elaidic acid minimally affected endothelial cell growth whereas linoelaidic acid completely inhibited growth at 100 mu m and imparted limited cytotoxicity up to 300 mu m stearic acid induced cytotoxicity at concentrations above 75 mu m while oleic and linoleic acids evoked gradual dosedependent growth inhibition with cytotoxicity occurring only at linoleic acid concentrations greater than 200 mu m in conclusion t181n9 and t182n6 fatty acids effectively incorporated into the phospholipid component of endothelial cells and subsequently induce a proinflammatory phenotype
milk and milk products are nutritious food items containing numerous essential nutrients but in the western societies the consumption of milk has decreased partly due to claimed negative health effects the content of oleic acid conjugated linoleic acid omega3 fatty acids short and medium chain fatty acids vitamins minerals and bioactive compounds may promote positive health effects fullfat milk has been shown to increase the mean gastric emptying time compared to halfskimmed milk thereby increasing the gastrointestinal transit time also the low ph in fermented milk may delay the gastric emptying hence it may be suggested that ingesting fullfat milk or fermented milk might be favourable for glycaemic  and appetite regulation for some persons milk proteins fat and milk sugar may be of health concern the interaction between carbohydrates  both natural milk sugar and added sugar and protein in milk exposed to heat may give products whose effects on health should be further studied and the increasing use of sweetened milk products should be questioned the concentration in milk of several nutrients can be manipulated through feeding regimes there is no evidence that moderate intake of milk fat gives increased risk of diseases
background cow milk is a natural source of the cis 9 trans 11 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid c9 t11cla and trans vaccenic acid va these fatty acids may be considered as functional foods and the concentration in milk can be increased by e g sunflower oil supplementation to the dairy cow feed the objective of this study was to compare the effects of regular butter with a special butter naturally enriched in c9 t11cla and va on plasma lipids in female growing pigs the experimental period lasted for three weeks and the two diets provided daily either 50 g c9 t11cla plus 151 g va or 13 g c9 t11cla plus 36 g va results the serum concentrations of c9 t11cla va and alphalinolenic acid were increased and myristic 14 0 and palmitic acid 16 0 were reduced in the pigs fed the clavarich butterdiet compared to regular butter but no differences in plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol cholesterol hdlcholesterol ldlcholesterol ldl particle size distribution or total cholesterolhdl cholesterol were observed among the two dietary treatment groups conclusion growing pigs fed diets containing butter naturally enriched in about 20 g c9 t11cla plus va daily for three weeks had increased serum concentrations of alphalinolenic acid and decreased myristic and palmitic acid compared to pigs fed regular butter implying a potential benefit of the cla va butter on serum fatty acid composition butter enriched in cla va does not appear to have significant effect on the plasma lipoprotein profile in pigs

hayes k c and a pronczuk 2010 replacing trans fat the argument for palm oil with a cautionary note on interesterification journal of the american college of nutrition 293 253s284s
to replace dietary trans fatty acids tfa two practical options exist revert to a natural saturated fat without cholesterol most likely palm oil or its fractions or move to a newer model of modified fat hardened by interesterification ie this review summarizes the relative risks for cardiovascular disease inherent in these options interestingly both types of fat have been the subject of nutritional scrutiny for approximately the last 40 years and both have positive and negative attributes only during that period has palm oil production developed to the point where it has become the major edible oil in world markets making clinical studies of it an important objective on the other hand approximately 25 human studies have fed interesterified fat in one form or another over this period some for weeks some as a single meal two types of diet designs exist several fed a small amount of interesterified fat usually incorporated within a margarine and stayed below the radar of biological detection of any abnormal metabolism a few fed interesterified fat that incorporated stearic acid as interesterified 180 ie180 even comparing it to trans fat and saturated fat as a major part of total daily calories to assess its metabolic impact per se these latter 5 to 6 studies clearly reveal negative biological effects on lipoproteins blood glucose insulin immune function or liver enzymes when relatively high intake of 1e180 or palmitic acid 1e160 were fed in fats with sn2saturated fatty acids high intake of 180 in natural fats can depress total lipoproteins while ie180 and 1e160 at high levels adversely affect lipoprotein metabolism still other studies have supplied interesterified fat as a single meal or fed such fat daily only in a single snack as opposed to incorporating the fat into the entire fat pool consumed at all meals in association with most foods which is the more physiological approach and more apt to elicit effects even in meal studies 1e180 typically delayed fat absorption postprandially indicating its effect on fat metabolism originating in part in the intestine mainly 2 saturated fatty acids 180 or 160 have been interesterified to harden oils using the 160 from fully hydrogenated palm oil or 180 from fully hydrogenated soybean oil as the source material it is not clear that 1e160 is as problematic as 1e180 but 1e160 has been studied less levels between 8 energy e and 12e from 180 as interestedfied fat the typical diet provides about 2e4e as 180 from natural fats show the most effect detection of adverse effects would seem to start around 7e8e as 1e180 but one can assume that effects are initiated even if undetected at a lower intake similar to the situation with tfa thus although an intake of 1e to 4e from 1e180 does not appear to influence lipoproteins it is not necessarily the only system affected the negative effects of 1e180 may be alleviated or masked by dilution with other fats especially by adding 182rich polyunsaturated oils to the diet this is similar to the trans fat story ie if a limited intake of tfa is heavily diluted with other oils the consumption of tfa fails to be detected as an adverse effect accordingly more research is warranted to determine the appropriateness of interesterified fat consumption particularly before it becomes insidiously embedded in the food supply similar to tfa and intake levels are achieved that compromise longterm health

dietary intake of trans fatty acids tfa has recently been linked to the incidence of coronary heart disease partially hydrogenated oils and milk and depot fat of ruminant animals are widely regarded as the major sources of dietary tfa data concerning tfa contents of industrially prepared food socalled convenience food are however scarce therefore the fatty acid composition of 52 canned meat products 51 dry products soups and sauces 51 bakery products and snacks and 74 ready prepared meals canned or deepfrozen was examined by gasliquid chromatography canned meat products or prepared meals are no major sources for dietary tfa both product groups provided less than 1 g100 g meat or serving contrary to this dried food items may contain up to g g tfa100 g product
abnormal lipid levels contribute significantly to the risk of coronary heart disease a major cardiovascular disease and a serious health problem various dietary and pharmacologic treatments have been devised to reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels soy protein soluble fiber and plant sterolestercontaining margarines are promising new foodcomponent candidates that may help to realize this goal of particular interest in this context is the ldlhdl ratio a strong predictor of cardiac events this report is a review of more than 50 recent trials to determine how such dietary components and garlic affect the ldlhdl ratio and other lipid parameters consumption of new soy products containing high fixed levels of isoflavones cotyledon soy fiber and soy phospholipids abacorr and abalonr significantly reduced the ldlhdl ratio by up to 27 soluble dietary fibers such as psyllium and beta glucan from oat bran had a variable effect on ldlcholesterol levels in the studies analyzed plant sterol esters when consumed in margarines lowered the ldlhdl ratio by up to 22 on average abacor and abalon reduced the ldlhdl ratio by 20 ldl cholesterol by 15 total cholesterol by 10 and triglycerides by 6 and increased hdl cholesterol by 5 the new soybased supplements may therefore play a valuable role in reducing cardiovascular risk
this study was undertaken to determine the effect of dietary supplementation of sunflower seed in cows on the chemical composition of milk and dairy products cream butter and butter oil were prepared from milk produced by cows fed a control diet control products or diet supplemented with 112 sunflour seed clarich products milk samples collected were determined for lactose a sample of clarich or control product was determined for fatty acid profile as well as fat protein and ash contents the index of atherogenicity ia and the index of thrombogenicity it were also calculated results revealed that there was no effect of the inclusion of sunflower seed in the diet on the lactose content in milk and total fat protein and ash contents in the dairy products average contents of conjugated linoleic acid cla and transvaccenic acid tva expressed as g100g total fatty acid were 054 and 16 respectively in the control products and 2 and 64 respectively in the clarich products the content of either cla or tva was approximately four fold higher in the latter products moreover clarich products showed considerably low ia and it which were respectively 384 and 250 less than those from control products fatty acid profiles were unaffected during processing which demonstrates that cla is a stable component in the dairy products analyzed it was concluded that dietary supplementation of sunflower seed in cows increases the cla and tva contents in milk which may contribute to the reduction of the risk of cardiovascular diseases in humans
saturated and trans fatty acids have been associated with the risk to develop cardiovascular diseases however healthpromoting effects are associated with consumption of anhydrous milk fat amf and ruminant trans fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid cla and vaccenic acid va contained in the lipid fraction of milk and dairy products the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of amf naturally enriched with cla and va in spontaneously hypertensive rats shr using sterculic oil to inhibit the conversion of va into cla the administration of amf to shr during 7 weeks exerted beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk biomarkers reduction of insulin blood lipids increase of adiponectin when sterculic oil was included some parameters were further ameliorated reduction of insulin increase of adiponectin sterculic oil alone reduced body weight and adiposity and improved blood pressure adiponectin and triglyceride levels
in recent years several studies have indicated a positive relationship between trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease maternal and infant diseases inflammatory diseases and cancer the world health organization manifested the need of decreasing the consumption of these fatty acids which culminated with the recommendation of their elimination in 2004 labeling is a measure that helps the population make food choices this article presents a literature review on trans fatty acids their formation health effects and the current measures to control their intake emphasizing food labeling the following databases were searched scopus pubmed scielo science direct and lilacs in addition national and international government sites covering the period from 1990 to 2012 were consulted the key words used in portuguese and english were trans fatty acids andor hydrogenated fat conjugated with labeling andor regulation andor legislation manufacturing individual and public measures stemming from governmental policies and education can help to reduce the consumption of trans fatty acids although brazilian law requires companies to report the amount of trans fatty acids per serving on their product labels the way this information is presented is questionable the effective reduction of trans fatty acids in food products can take considerable time because of the necessary cultural and technological changes it should be noted that any initiative regarding trans fatty acids is important since it will improve the general populations health

several studies in humans have demonstrated the hypocholesterolemic effect of plant sterol consumption it is unclear whether plant sterols regulate lipoprotein metabolism in the liver and intestines thereby decreasing the levels of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins we investigated the effect of the three main phytosterols stigmasterol campesterol and betasitosterol on lipoprotein production in hepg2 human liver cells and caco2 human intestinal cells and the mechanisms involved cells were incubated for 24 h with 50 mu moll of the different phytosterols or 10 mu moll of atorvastatin very lowdensity lipoprotein levels measured by apolipoprotein apo b 100 in hepg2 cells and chylomicron levels measured by apob48 in caco2 cells were measured using western blotting intracellular cholesterol levels were measured using gas chromatography analysis was carried out using students ttest and anova secretion levels of apob100 significantly decreased by approximately 30 after incubation with all phytosterols compared to control in addition cholesterol ester ce concentrations significantly decreased when hepg2 cells were incubated with the phytosterols compared to control cells secretion of apob48 from intestinal cells significantly decreased by 15 with stigmasterol 16 with campesterol and 19 betasitosterol compared to control collectively the data suggests that plant sterols limit lipid ce availability in cells decreases in circulating levels of ldl and chylomicron remnants seen in humans with the consumption of margarine phytosterols are possibly due to their effect on lipid production in cells and would therefore reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease c 2005 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved

high dose daily intake of plant sterols decreases the uptake of cholesterol in the intestine by competitive mechanisms and thus leads to reduced serum levels of total and ldlcholesterol by this the commercialization of plant sterol enriched functional food products is rapidly increasing subjects using these kinds of diet present a duplication of their serum plant sterol levels after longterm intake in analogy to cholesterol plant sterols such as campesterol and sitosterol can be oxidized to oxyphytosterols and these may counteract the primary antiatherosclerotic action of cholesterol lowering in order to investigate the whole spectrum of the consequences following high plant sterol intake a highly sensitive and specific isotope dilution gas chromatographymass spectrometry method for the analysis of 7oxygenated campesterolsitosterol in trace amounts in human serum is presented in this paper the validation was based on limits for detection and quantification recovery precision and minimization of autoxidation during workup our results show an overall coefficient of variation  10 for the precision the lowest limits for detection and quantification for 7 alphahydroxycampesterol were 7 pgml and 23 pgml respectively data for overall sum recovery ranged from 92 to 115 we practically used this method for analysis of oxyphytosterols simultaneously with plant sterol concentrations in serum from healthy volunteers sixteen subjects were treated with plant sterol enriched margarine 3 gday for 28 days the results showed a significant increase of the oxyphytosterol 7 betahydroxysitosterol from 119  054 before intake to 224  124 ngml mean  sd 867 p  0007 after intake of the margarine there was a highly significant correlation between the serum levels of campesterol and the sum of 7oxygenated campesterol r2  0915 p  0001 and sitosterol and the sum of 7oxygenated sitosterol r2  0915 p  0001 we can conclude from this study that the analytic method is well suited for detection of ops even at trace amounts c 2011 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
aim to quantify the number of premature deaths from coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke that potentially could be avoided annually among the australian population if a sustained 10 reduction in the mean population level of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol were to be achieved methods data were obtained on the number of deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke in the australian population subdivided into age and sex strata and on the mean population level of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol published relative risks 95 ci from a metaanalysis of lipidlowering therapy were used to calculate the reduction in the relative risk for coronary heart disease and stroke associated with a 5 10 and 15 reduction in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol the expected number of deaths from coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke avoidable with a 10 reduction in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol was modelled secondary analyses were performed assuming reductions in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol of 5 and 15 results a 10 reduction in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol would prevent 2279 deaths from coronary heart disease 95 ci 20252531 deaths and 641 deaths from ischaemic stroke 95 ci 440881 deaths the projected benefits are greatest among the elderly although some benefit would be expected in all age and sex groups and among individuals with a broad range of baseline levels of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol conclusions a small leftward shift in the lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol distribution of the adult australian population has the potential to save about 3000 lives from coronary heart disease and stroke annually achieving this goal will require the active participation of key public health food industry and government stakeholders

objective currently the published information on trans fatty acid composition of foods is incomplete and of questionable accuracy detailed fatty acid analysis of over 200 foods was undertaken for the purpose of determining the variability in trans fatty acid content among foods within a product category and the significance of this variability to the estimation of trans fatty acids intakes from analysis of dietary intake data methods the analysis of food fatty acids used gasliquid chromatography with 100 m capillary columns and standardized methodologies for food sampling fat extraction separation and quantification of trans fatty acid isomers for the purposes of this report trans refers to all nonnaturally occurring isomers including trans cistrans geometric and positional isomers results the results show that the amount of trans fatty acids varies considerably among foods within a category reflecting differences in the fats and oils used in the manufacturing or preparation process for example the range of trans fatty acids in 17 brands of crackers was 23 to 51 total fatty acids representing differences of from 1 to 13 g trans fatty acids per 100 g cracker the large errors that may arise in estimates of the trans fatty acid intake of an individual are illustrated by analyses of the potential trans fatty acid intake in a sample diet for each food as calculated using the minimum and maximum values for trans fatty acids within a given category the results of these analyses show estimates of trans fatty acid intake from a low of 14 to 254 g a day for the same diet conclusion this study shows that the wide variability in trans fatty acid content of different foods may result in large errors in the estimation of trans fatty acid intake of individuals and potentially groups

trans fatty acids tfa are produced either by hydrogenation of unsaturated oils or by biohydrogenation in the stomach of ruminant animals vanaspati ghee and margarine have high contents of tfa a number of studies have shown an association of tfa consumption and increased risk of cardiovascular disease cvd this increased risk is because tfa increase the ratio of ldl cholesterol to hdl cholesterol food and agriculture organization of the united nations and world health organization have come up with the recommendation that the contents of tfa in human dietary fat should be reduced to less than 4 there is high prevalence of cvd in pakistan high consumption of vanaspati ghee which contains 142343 of tfa could be one of the factors for this increased burden of cvd in pakistan consumption of dietary fat low in tfa would be helpful in reducing the risk of cvd in south asia denmark by banning the sale of food items with tfa has brought down the number of deaths due to coronary heart disease by nearly 50 over a period of 20 years public awareness about the adverse effects of tfa on human health would be extremely important media can play a very effective role in educating the masses and advocating the policy for the sale of only low tfa food items literature sources google and us national library of medicine national institute of health were the sources of papers cited in this review article
intake of trans fatty acids tfa which are consumed by eating foods made from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease this relation can be explained by many factors including tfas negative effect on endothelial function and reduced nitric oxide no bioavailability in this study we investigated the effects of three different tfa 2 common isomers of c18 found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and a c18 isomer found from ruminantderiveddairy products and meat on endothelial nfkappa b activation and nitric oxide no production human endothelial cells were treated with increasing concentrations of elaidic transc18 1 9 trans linoelaidic transc18 2 9 trans 12 trans and transvaccenic transc18 1 11 trans for 3 h both elaidic and linoelaidic acids were associated with increasing nfkappa b activation as measured by il6 levels and phosphorylation of i kappa b alpha and impairment of endothelial insulin signaling and no production whereas transvaccenic acid was not associated with these responses we also measured superoxide production which has been hypothesized to be necessary in fatty aciddependent activation of nfkappa b both elaidic acid and linoelaidic acid are associated with increased superoxide production whereas transvaccenic acid which did not induce inflammatory responses did not increase superoxide production we observed differential activation of endothelial superoxide production nfkappa b activation and reduction in no production by different c18 isomers suggesting that the location and number of trans double bonds effect endothelial nfkappa b activation
background conjugated linoleic acid cis9 trans11 cla and trans11 vaccenic acid va are found naturally in ruminantderived foods cla has been shown to have numerous potential health related effects and has been extensively investigated more recently we have shown that va has lipidlowering properties associated with reduced hepatic lipidogenesis and chylomicron secretion in the jcrlacp rat the aim of this study was to evaluate potential additional hypolipidemic effects of purified forms of cla and va in an animal model of the metabolic syndrome the jcrlacp rat methods twenty four obese jcrlacp rats were randomized and assigned to one of three nutritionally adequate isocaloric diets containing 1 ww cholesterol and 15 ww fat for 16 wk 1 control diet cd 2 10 ww cis9 trans11 cla cla 3 10 ww va and 1 ww cis9 trans11 cla vacla lean rats were fed the cd to represent normolipidemic conditions results fasting plasma triglyceride tg total cholesterol and ldlcholesterol concentrations were reduced in obese rats fed either the cla diet or the vacla diet as compared to the obese control group p  005 p  0001 p  0001 p  001 p  001 p  0001 respectively the vacla diet reduced plasma tg and ldlcholesterol to the level of the normolipidemic lean rats and further decreased nonesterified fatty acids compared to the cla diet alone interestingly rats fed the vacla diet had a higher food intake but lower body weight than the cla fed group p  005 liver weight and tg content were lower in rats fed either cla p  005 or va cla diets p  0001 compared to obese control consistent with a decreased relative protein abundance of hepatic acetylcoa carboxylase in both treatment groups p  001 the activity of citrate synthase was increased in liver and adipose tissue of rats fed cla and vacla diets p  0001 compared to obese control suggesting increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative capacity conclusion we demonstrate that the hypolipidemic effects of chronic cis9 trans11 cla supplementation on circulating dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis are enhanced by the addition of va in the jcrlacp rat

the effects of different fatty acids in vegetable and animal fatsoils are discussed with regard to carcinogenesis atherogenesis and body fat depots in experiments with animal models it has been demonstrated that milk fatbased diets produce fewer tumours than polyunsaturated vegetable oilbased diets butter is hypercholesterolemic compared with many other fat sources such as margarines not hightrans margarines and vegetable oil there is evidence that whole milk does not affect cholesterol fractions conjugated linoleic acids cla were identified as antiatherogenic compounds in ruminant milk fat butter contains about 10 short and mediumchain fatty acids which are mainly oxidized in the liver longchain fatty acids are directly stored in the fat depots furthermore clas not present in vegetable oils reduce body fat deposition in animal experiments and increases fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells higher lean body mass
chronically hemodialyzed hd patients frequently suffer from quantitative and even more often qualitative serum lipids disorders mostly they have increased triglycerides and vldlcholesterol slightly increased or normal total and ldlcholesterol and decreased hdlcholesterol concentrations the study compared lipid profile between two groups of chronic hd patients coming from regionally distinct areas the continental and the maritime one the aim was to examine the hypothetic influence of their different dietary habits on lipid profile the study included 72 patients from continental region 39 men and 50 from maritime part of the country 30 men patients suffering from diabetes mellitus hypothyroidism liver disease alcoholics as well as sevelamer treated patients were not included prior to a hd session the patients were determined fasting total cholesterol triglycerides hdl and ldlcholesterol total proteins albumins and creactive protein serum concentrations all patients were undergoing bicarbonate hemodialysis with polysulphone dialysers of low permeability the continental group of patients were somewhat older undergoing hd for longer period of time of lower height greater weight greater body mass index higher total 470  1091 442  102 mmoll and ldlcholesterol 278  074266  075 mmoll concentrations while lower triglycerides 172  084181  083 mmoll and hdlcholesterol 113  042116  054 mmoll however all the differences were without statistical significance chisquare test showed that the continental group of patients consumed more often pork bacon smoked and cured meats margarine butter walnuts almonds garlic cream and fullfat cheese than fish they prepare food more often with lard and sunflower oil almost every fourth continental patient received statins while only every 25th in the maritime group of patients there were not any statistically significant chisquare values for differences in frequencies of patients with total cholesterol greater than 52 mmoll triglycerides above 16 mmoll hdlcholesterol less than 11 mmoll ldlcholesterol greater than 26 mmoll obesity and malnutrition between the two groups based on the results of this study we have concluded that diet has significant influence on lipid profile of hd patients even though the continental and the maritime groups of patients differed significantly in diet they were similar in plasmatic lipoprotein concentrations however this similarity was ascribed only to statin treatment which was more frequent in the continental group of patients the influence of esrd and hd as a method of renal replacement therapy on lipid profile was not more dominant than diet
objective to examine the effect of plant stanols on lipids and endothelial function in prepubertal children with familial hypercholesterolemia fh study design children with fh n  42 aged 712 years were enrolled in a doubleblind crossover trial in which they consumed 500 ml of it lowfat yogurt enriched with 20 g of plant stanols and 500 ml of a lowfat placebo yogurt for 4 week separated by a 6week washout period lipid profiles and endothelial function were assessed after both consumption periods endothelial function was measured as flowmediated dilation fmd of the brachial artery results this daily intake of 20 g of stanols significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol tc by 75 and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc by 92 its compared with placebo highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol anti triglyceride levels remained unaltered the reduction of ldlc levels did not improve fmd which was 105  51 after plant stanol consumption and 106  50 after placebo consumption respectively p  852 conclusion this study demonstrates that plant stanols reduce ldlc levels in children with fh without improving endothelial function
a multistage temperatureprogrammed fractionating crystallization process was carried out to examine the effects of the presence of stearic acid sa oleic acid oa and linoleic acid la on the separation of elaidic acid ea the results showed that the efficiency of fractionating crystallization of ea depended largely on the crystallization temperature initial concentration of ea and presence of sa the content of sa plays very important role for the fractionating performance it was a characteristic observation that only when sa 2 substantial crystallization of ea 50 in stepwise crystal fractions were obtained regardless of the initial concentration of sa in general sa induced crystallization of ea in earlier stage but delayed further crystallization of ea in later stage the crystallization of ea was independent from coexisting oa and la after reduction of ea content in solution to certain extent 710 at 20 degrees c further reduction of ea content requires much lower crystallization temperatures 40 degrees c similar to 5 with significant loss of oa indicating the limitation of the method instead sa content could be easily reduced down to low concentration similar to 05 at 20 degrees c
background trans palmitoleic acid t16ln7 or 161t9 in the delta nomenclature usually applied to trans fatty acids and used herein arouses great scientific interest because it has been suggested to serve as a biomarker for lower risks of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease objective although 161t9 has been assumed to derive from dietary sources we examined the hypothesis that 161t9 might also be endogenously produced from its metabolic precursor vaccenic acid t18ln7 or 181t11 design we reevaluated fatty acid data obtained from one human intervention study and one cellular model in both of which 181t11 was supplemented both studies have already been published but to our knowledge 161t9 has not yet been considered this reanalysis of the datasets was reasonable because a new methodology for identifying 161 cis and trans isomers allowed us to address the subject presented in this article results data showed that the systemic or intracellular increase in 161t9 was strongly correlated with the increase in 181t11 after the dietary intake or cellular uptake of 181t11 the conversion rate in humans was on average 17 conclusion our findings suggest that endogenous 161t9 is not as has been assumed exclusively diet derived but may also be produced by the partial beta oxidation of dietary 181t11
consumption of takeaway and fast food continues to increase in western societies and is particularly widespread among adolescents since food is known to play an important role in both the development and prevention of many diseases there is no doubt that the observed changes in dietary patterns affect the quality of the diet as well as public health the present review examines the nutritional characteristics of takeaway and fast food items including their energy density total fat and saturated and trans fatty acid content it also reports on the association between the consumption of such foods and health outcomes while the available evidence suggests the nutrient profiles of takeaway and fast foods may contribute to a variety of negative health outcomes findings on the specific effects of their consumption on health are currently limited and in recent years changes have been taking place that are designed to improve them therefore more studies should be directed at gaining a firmer understanding of the nutrition and health consequences of eating takeaway and fast foods and determining the best strategy to reduce any negative impact their consumption may have on public health
aim to compare the blood glucoselowering effect of a highly viscous fiber blend vfb added to a starchy snack on postprandial glycemia between healthy participants and participants with diabetes mellitus methods ten healthy participants 4 men and 6 women aged 28  26 years body mass index bmi 243  08 kgm2 and 9 participants with diabetes mellitus type 2 3 men and 6 women aged 68  38 years bmi 288  12 kgm2 on four separate occasions took either 50 g available carbohydrates as control biscuits biscuits with 10 g of highly viscous fiber blend white bread with 12 g of margarine or white bread alone postprandial blood glucose response glycemic index gi and palatability were determined results mean 95 confidence interval gi values of the viscous fiber blend biscuits were 26 1636 and 37 2747 gi units for healthy participants and participants with diabetes mellitus respectively these values were significantly lower than those of white bread white bread with 12 g of margarine and control biscuits p  0001 paired t test both in healthy participants gi 100 108 57159 and 101 44158 respectively and participants with diabetes mellitus gi 100 103 79127 and 94 78110 respectively viscous fiber blend significantly reduced the glycemic index by 74 74 gi unitsg of fiber in healthy participants and by 63 63 gi unitsg of fiber in participants with diabetes the gi did not differ between control meals in both healthy participants and participants with diabetes there were no significant differences in palatability among the types of meals although participants with diabetes found the viscous fiber blend biscuits more palatable p  0002 t test conclusion viscous fiber blend is a very potent and palatable soluble fiber addition to a starchy snack which is able to reduce the glycemic response to a similar extent in both healthy participants and individuals with diabetes mellitus biscuits with low gi and possibly other viscous fiber blend fortified starchy foods may potentially be a useful replacement of high gi snack foods in the diet
it is likely that plant food consumption throughout much of human evolution shaped the dietary requirements of contemporary humans diets would have been high in dietary fiber vegetable protein plant sterols and associated phytochemicals and low in saturated and transfatty acids and other substrates for cholesterol biosynthesis to meet the bodys needs for cholesterol we believe genetic differences and polymorphisms were conserved by evolution which tended to raise serum cholesterol levels as a result modern man with a radically different diet and lifestyle especially in middle age is now recommended to take medications to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease experimental introduction of high intakes of viscous fibers vegetable proteins and plant sterols in the form of a possible myocene diet of leafy vegetables fruit and nuts lowered serum ldlcholesterol in healthy volunteers by over 30 equivalent to first generation statins the standard cholesterollowering medications furthermore supplementation of a modern therapeutic diet in hyperlipidemic subjects with the same components taken as oat barley and psyllium for viscous fibers soy and almonds for vegetable proteins and plant sterolenriched margarine produced similar reductions in ldlcholesterol as the myocenelike diet and reduced the majority of subjects blood lipids concentrations into the normal range we conclude that reintroduction of plant food components which would have been present in large quantities in the plant based diets eaten throughout most of human evolution into modern diets can correct the lipid abnormalities associated with contemporary eating patterns and reduce the need for pharmacological interventions c 2002 elsevier science inc all rights reserved
only a few studies have been published on the postprandial effects of different fatty acids in obese subjects therefore the present study investigated the effects of three test meals containing palm oil po lard ld or puffpastry margarine ppm all normal dietary ingredients on postprandial lipid and hormone responses in normalweight and obese young women the study was performed as a randomized crossover design the fats differed in the content of palmitic acid stearic acid and traits monounsaturated fatty acids allowing a dietary comparison of different solid fatty acids the obese women had significantly higher fasting concentrations and postprandial responses of plasma total triacylglycerol tag chylomicrontag and insulin compared with the normalweight women but there was no significant difference in the postprandial responses between the three test meals the obese women had fasting concentrations of leptin four times greater than the normalweight women there were no postprandial changes in the concentrations of leptin the fasting concentrations of hdlcholesterol were significantly lower in the obese women than in the normalweight women whereas there was no significant difference between the two groups in the concentrations of total cholesterol or ldlcholesterol these results provide evidence that obese women have exaggerated lipid and hormone responses compared with normalweight women but the different contents of saturated and trans monounsaturated fatty acids provided by po ld and ppm have no effect in either group

recent studies of dietary habits in children and adolescents performed in spain show that a high percentage of the daily energy intake corresponds to fat 420430 these findings show an excessive contribution of saturated fatty acids and also a considerable supply of trans fatty acids these compounds are formed generally during partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils a process that converts vegetable oils into semisolid fats also in some cases naturally occurring trans fatty acids in smaller amounts in meat and dairy products from ruminants cows sheep these trans fatty acids are produced by the action of bacteria in the ruminant stomach by reactions of biohydrogenation on the other hand metabolic studies have clearly shown that traits fatty acids increase ldl cholesterol and reduce hdl cholesterol our results show that major sources of trans fatty acids in commercial spanish foods are fastfood hamburger french fries snacks bakery products cakes donuts biscuits margarines and dehydrated soups

effects of butter and 2 types of margarine on blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were compared in a controlled diet study with 23 men and 23 women table spreads added to a common basal diet provided 83 of energy as fat diets averaged 346 of energy as fat and 155 as protein each diet was fed for 5 wk in a 3 x 3 latinsquare design one margarine tfam approximated the average trans monoene content of trans fatty acidcontaining margarines in the united states 17 trans fatty acids by dry wt the other margarine pufam was free of ti ans unsaturated fatty acids it contained approximately twice the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of tfam 49 compared with 27 polyunsaturated fatty acids the tubtype margarines had similar physical properties at ambient temperature fasting blood lipids and lipoproteins were determined in 2 samples taken from the subjects during the fifth week of each dietary treatment compared with butter total cholesterol was 35 lower p  0009 after consumption of tfam and 54 lower p  0001 after consumption of pufam similarly ldl cholesterol was 49 lower p  0005 and 67 lower pi 0001 after consumption of tfam and pufam respectively neither margarine differed from butter in its effect on hdl cholesterol or triacylglycerols thus consumption of tfam or pufam improved blood lipid profiles for the major lipoproteins associated with cardiovascular risk when compared with butter with a greater improvement with pufam than with tfam
palm oil and soybean oil are the 2 most widely used cooking oils in the world palm oil is consumed mainly in developing countries where morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease cvd are on the rise although claims about adverse or protective effects of these oils are commonly made there are no epidemiologic studies assessing the association between these oils and cardiovascular disease endpoints we examined whether consumption of palm oil relative to soybean oil and other unsaturated oils predominantly sunflower is associated with myocardial infarction mi in costa rica the cases n  2111 were survivors of a first acute mi and were matched to randomly selected population controls n  2111 dietary intake was assessed with a validated serniquantitative ffq adipose tissue profiles of essential fatty acids were assessed to validate cooking oil intake and found to be consistent with selfreported major oils used for cooking the data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression palm oil users were more likely to have an mi than users of soybean oil odds ratio or  133 95 ci 108163 or other cooking oils or  123 ci 099152 but they did not differ from users of soybean oil with a high transfatty acid content or  114 ci 084156 these data suggest that as currently used in costa rica and most likely in many other developing countries the replacement of palm oil with a polyunsaturated nonhydrogenated vegetable oil would reduce the risk of mi
palmitelaidic c161 trans9 acid has been suggested to have beneficial effects on human health including reduced adiposity objectives of this research were to quantify the amounts of palmitelaidic acid in beef samples and determine the effect of palmitelaidic acid supplementation on lipogenesis in bovine preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro for the first objective palmitelaidic acid content of lm samples from steers finished on forage or concentrate systems was determined palmitelaidic acid in lm samples from foragefinished beef ranged from 10 to 17 mg100 g of muscle corresponding to 052 to 065 of total fatty acids forage species grazed during finishing and animal age at harvest also altered palmitelaidic acid concentrations and contents in the lm of foragefinished beef palmitelaidic acid concentration of concentratefinished beef was lower p  005 025 vs 056 however because of increased p  005 total fatty acid content with concentrate finishing amount of palmitelaidic acid was similar p  005 to beef from steers finished on pearl millet and greater p  005 than those finished on alfalfa for the second objective undifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes were supplemented with 0 to 300 mu m of palmitelaidic acid palmitelaidic acid supplementation reduced p  005 cell viability of undifferentiated preadipocytes at greater levels 150 and 300 mu m but did not affect p  005 the viability of differentiated adipocytes in preadipocytes palmitelaidic acid increased p  005 palmitelaidic and trans11 vaccenic c181 trans11 acids at high levels of supplementation 300 mu m in adipocytes palmitelaidic acid supplementation increased p  005 palmitelaidic acid trans11 vaccenic acid and total fatty acid content in addition cis9 trans11 cla also increased p  005 with palmitelaidic acid supplementation in adipocytes these results indicate that palmitelaidic acid can be elongated in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and desaturated in adipocytes to generate trans11 vaccenic acid and cis9 trans11 cla respectively beef products are a source of palmitelaidic acid in the human diet which can be elongated and desaturated to produce trans11 vaccenic acid and cis9 trans11 cla
kalac p and e samkova 2010 the effects of feeding various forages on fatty acid composition of bovine milk fat a review czech journal of animal science 5512 521537
the nutritional image of bovine milk fat has suffered for years because of the association of saturated fatty acids and coronary heart disease thus the alteration of fatty acid composition has been a longterm strategy forages even though containing a relatively low level of lipids are the cheapest and often the major source of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids in ruminant diets recent progress in the research of factors affecting fatty acid content and composition in fresh and preserved forages and the associations between feeding such forages and milk fat profile are reviewed milk from cows grazed or fed fresh forage especially from speciesrich grasslands or forage legumes has a considerably higher ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids and a higher content of nutritionally beneficial transfatty acids eg cla vaccenic acid than milk from cows fed silage or hay grass and legume silages seem to affect the fatty acid profile more propitiously than maize silage
ten margarine brands of pakistan were analyzed for their fatty acid composition with emphasis on trans fatty acids tfa using gc ms saturated cismonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids were present at 242581 57354 and 38374 of total fatty acids respectively among the saturated fatty acids palmitic acid 169338 was dominant in all analyzed margarine brands and its higher amount indicates that palm oil was a major contributor in the margarine manufacturing among samples tested only one contained a low level of tfa 22 while the rest contained very high amounts of tfa 115348 which clearly shows that hydrogenated oils were used in the formulation of margarines fatty acid profiles demonstrated that all samples belong to the hard margarine category containing high amounts of trans and saturated fatty acids which is an alarming issue for the health of consumers c 2008 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
sugar cane policosanols scp have been shown to exert antioxidant properties in various studies conducted in cuba independent studies have since reported no significant effect of scp consumption on oxidized ldl levels the objective of the present study was to confirm the effects of cuban scp on ldl oxidation using a highprecision capture elisa procedure in hypercholesterolemic individuals twentyone otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic men and postmenopausal women participated in a randomized double blind crossover study where they received 10 mgday of policosanol or a placebo incorporated in margarine as an evening snack for a period of 28 days subjects maintained their usual dietary and exercise habits throughout the duration of the study blood was collected on the first as well as the last 2 days of the trial ldl oxidation was measured from plasma using a solid phase twosite enzyme immunoassay a lack of effect of scp was observed on ldl cholesterol levels as well as no difference in ldl oxidation between the scp treatment and placebo at the end of the intervention period subject body weights remained stable throughout the study and showed no significant correlation with ldl oxidation levels absolute levels of plasma ldl cholesterol were significantly p  005 correlated with plasma concentrations of oxidized ldl the findings of the present study suggest that scp do not significantly affect ldl oxidation our results align with results of recent policosanol research questioning the efficacy of these natural extracts as cardioprotective agents

perceptions of the health effects of trans fatty acids particularly in the form of margarine have undergone several changes during the past 10 years what was once heralded as the healthy alternative to butter now assumes the role of coconspirator a new study finds that consumption of trans fatty acids such as those found in stick margarine and shortening have negative effects on lipoprotein profiles that are comparable to those of saturated fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases therefore it is recommended that consumers reduce intakes of both saturated and trans fatty acids
foods with plant stanol or sterol esters lower serum cholesterol levels we summarize the deliberations of 32 experts on the efficacy and safety of sterols and stanols a metaanalysis of 41 trials showed that intake of 2 gd of stanols or sterols reduced lowdensity lipoprotein ldl by 10 higher intakes added little efficacy is similar for sterols and stanols but the food form may substantially affect ldl reduction effects are additive with diet or drug interventions eating foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in stanols or sterols can reduce ldl by 20 adding sterols or stanols to statin medication is more effective than doubling the statin dose a metaanalysis of 10 to 15 trials per vitamin showed that plasma levels of vitamins a and d are not affected by stanols or sterols alpha carotene lycopene and vitamin e levels remained stable relative to their carrier molecule ldl beta carotene levels declined but adverse health outcomes were not expected sterolenriched foods increased plasma sterol levels and workshop participants discussed whether this would increase risk in view of the marked increase of atherosclerosis in patients with homozygous phytosterolemia this risk is believed to be largely hypothetical and any increase due to the small increase in plasma plant sterols may be more than offset by the decrease in plasma ldl there are insufficient data to suggest that plant stanols or sterols either prevent or promote colon carcinogenesis safety of sterols and stanols is being monitored by followup of samples from the general population however the power of such studies to pick up infrequent increases in common diseases if any exist is limited a trial with clinical outcomes probably would not answer remaining questions about infrequent adverse effects trials with surrogate end points such as intimamedia thickness might corroborate the expected efficacy in reducing atherosclerosis however present evidence is sufficient to promote use of sterols and stanols for lowering ldl cholesterol levels in persons at increased risk for coronary heart disease
trans fatty acids raise plasma lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels in volunteers when exchanged for cis unsaturated fatty acids in the diet in addition trans fatty acids may lower highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels and raise triglyceride and lipoproteina levels in plasma trans and cis unsaturated fatty acids are thus not equivalent and diets aimed at reducing the risk of coronary heart disease should be low in both trans and saturated fatty acids
inconsistent observations in epidemiologic studies on the association between total fat intake and colorectal cancer may be ascribed to opposing effects of individual fatty acids and the presence of other dietary constituents that modify luminal or systemic lipid exposure we analyzed the data from a populationbased casecontrol study that included 1163 cases and 1501 controls to examine the effects of individual fatty acid groups on colorectal cancer risk as well as their interactions with calcium and fiber intake odds ratios or and 95 confidence intervals cl were estimated by unconditional logistic regression model according to quartile levels of energyadjusted fatty acid intake in the bivariable analyses the risk of colorectal cancer increased with trans fatty acid tfa intake or for top vs bottom quartile  146 95 ci 117159 pvalue for a trend 0001 but the associations was substantially attenuated in multivariable analyses p value for a trend  0176 however a significant linear trend in the multivariable or p  0029 for tfa was present for subjects with lower calcium intake furthermore multivariable ors progressively decreased with increasing both omega3 and omega6 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake pvalues for linear trend 0033 and 0011 respectively for subjects with lower dietary fiber intake these interactions were also significant or marginally significant p  0085 for tfa 0029 for omega3 and 0068 for omega6 our results suggest that populations with lower intake of luminal modifiers ie calcium and fiber may have differential risks of colorectal cancer associated with dietary fatty acid intake
because trans fatty acids tfas are a potent risk factor for coronary heart disease it is important to know the amount of tfa consumed we estimated tfa intakes of japanese university students by direct measurement subjects included 118 students 57 males and 61 females in two regions of japan kanto tokyo area and okinawa a dietary survey was conducted over six consecutive days using dietary records and photographic records a singleday meal in the survey period was reproduced to measure tfa content by gas chromatography the median values of tfa intakes and energy percentage estimated by the contents of reproduced meals for men were 043 gd 022 in kanto and 030 gd 014 in okinawa corresponding values for women were 049 gd 029 and 073 gd 035 respectively compared to the group with a low tfa intake the subjects with a high tfa intake consumed significantly more energy from total fat and saturated fatty acids and had a high ratio of tfalinoleic acid in addition multiple regression analysis showed the intakes of ma were positively associated with those of saturated fatty acids and groups of nonessential groceries such as cookies cakes and pastries in conclusion the tfa intakes of these survey subjects were relatively lower than the who recommended energy ratio 1 however nutritional education on dietary habits seems indispensable for those subjects who are consuming high volumes of tfa
oxidative modification of lowdensity lipoprotein ldl has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis during the oxidation of ldl cholesteryl esters the major lipid components in ldl are oxidized to cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides ceooh the isomers of ceooh may reflect the reactive species that initiate the peroxidation reaction in the current study a novel analytical method for the determination of ceooh isomers especially cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide isomers was developed using the combination of two chromatographic techniques i thinlayer chromatography blotting with diphenyl1pyrenylphosphine dppp fluorescent detection dppptlc blotting and ii gas chromatographyelectron ionizationmass spectrometry gceims ceooh was applied to dppptlc blotting the obtained dpppderived fluorescent spots containing cholesteryl ester hydroxides were extracted and derivatized hydrogenation transmethylation and trimethylsilylation and the formed methyl estertrimethylsilylether derivatives of hydroxyoctadecenoic acid were then analyzed by gceims the ceooh isomers were determined by selected ion monitoring of isomerspecific fragment ions originated from the alphacleavage of the trimethylsilyloxyl group using these two chromatographic techniques we were able to detect isomeric ceooh in the oxidized human ldl our results indicated that gceims analysis combined with dppptlc blot is a specific method for analyzing cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide isomers in biological samples such as oxidized ldl c 2006 elsevier inc all rights reserved
purpose the consumption of transfatty acids is associated with increasing coronary heart disease risk when oils are partially hydrogenised to margarine form trans isomers of fatty acids are formed in this study we investigated the effects of dietary trans9 181 octadecenoic acid isomer on liver cell membrane nak atpase enzyme activity fat composition and lipid metabolism method and material this study was conducted on two groups of rats study and control study group was given 50 mgday trans9 181 octadecenoic acid isomers for ten days fatty acid composition of serum and liver tissue was analyzed using gas chromatography results study group showed trans9 18 1 fatty acid presence while control group did not thus trans9 18 1 octadecenoic acid isomer is not a naturally occurring compound the meaningful increase of c182 6n fatty acid and meaningful decrease of c204 6n in study group show that trans9 181 octadecenoic acid isomers affected desaturation activity and prevented c182 6n fatty acid from turning into c20 4 6n rats fed with trans9 181 octadecenoic acid showed decreased hdl and hdl2 cholesterol levels no change was observed in hdl3 ldl total cholesterol triglyceride and nak atpase activity our findings combined with current literature allow us to conclude sine tfas change serum hdl and hdl2 cholesterol levels nutritions containing tfa may increase the risk of heart disease
background it has been hypothesized that fatty acids derived from a diet high in saturated fat may negatively affect endothelial function more significantly than a diet high in unsaturated fat nevertheless the effects of the longterm ingestion of monounsaturated fatty acids on endothelial function have been poorly studied methods to examine the chronic effects of monounsaturated eg extra virgin olive oil evoo or saturated eg margarine m fatty acidrich diets on the development of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction in rats three groups of rats were fed control highevoo or highm diets for 20 weeks body weight energy consumption insulin resistance lipid peroxidation and in vitro vascular reactivity with and without metformin were assessed during the study period results both highfat diets produced obesity and insulin resistance evoofed rats showed smaller increases in total cholesterol and arterial lipid peroxidation when compared with mfed rats vascular reactivity to phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside was not modified but the vasodilating effect of carbachol was especially reduced in the mfed rats compared with the evoofed or control groups metformin addition to the incubation media decreased the vascular response to phenylephrine decrease that was lower in rats fed with both high fat diets and increased the carbachol and nitroprusside effects but the metforminenhanced response to carbachol was lower in the m group conclusions our results suggest that feeding rats with high quantities of evoo despite producing obesity and insulin resistance produces low levels of circulating cholesterol and arterial lipoperoxidation compared to m fed rats and shows a preserved endothelial response to carbachol effect that is significantly enhanced by metformin only in rats fed with control and evoo diets
background this study was performed to determine the blood pressure bp percentile curves by height as well as to assess the prevalence of high bp and its influencing factors among children in the first national survey in this field in iran design a multicentre national crosssectional survey methods this study was performed in 23 provinces among a representative sample of 21 111 students aged 618 years results age and sexspecific percentile curves of systolic and diastolic bp were obtained by height a comparison of the values obtained corresponding to the 90th percentiles with the second task force cutoffs showed that the bp values and trends were relatively similar in both studies the overall prevalence of systolic diastolic as well as systolic or diastolic hypertension according to the second task force study 95th percentile cutoff points were 42 54 and 77 respectively without a significant sex difference a history of low birthweight overweight taller height the consumption of solid hydrogenated fat as well as the frequency of fast food consumption increased the risk of both systolic and diastolic hypertension male sex large waist and low education of the mother were the risks for systolic hypertension whereas the risk of diastolic hypertension rose with living in an urban area attending public school low physical activity level having a housewife mother and a positive family history of obesity especially in the parents conclusion considering the effect of modifiable environmental factors on the childrens bp encouraging breast feeding and a healthy lifestyle may have an important effect on public health

objectives to assess the serum lipid profiles of iranian adolescents and their correlation with dietary fat intake and to evaluate the knowledge attitude and practice kap of students parents and school staff methods the subjects of this crosssectional study were 2000 students 1000 girls and 1000 boys ages 1118 years selected by multistage random sampling and one of their parents 2000 subjects as well as 500 school staff in urban and rural areas of two provinces in iran one for further interventions and the other for reference the data were obtained by questionnaires anthropometric measurements 3day food record form and a 20item food frequency questionnaire ffq all serum lipids were determined in the same laboratory results although the percentage of fat intake 212  04 among the adolescents was within the recommended daily allowance rda less than or equal to 30 in most cases the percentiles of serum total cholesterol tc lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc and triglyceride tg were significantly higher and the percentiles of highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc were lower than standard values according to lipid research clinics lrc data for example the mean tc values for girls in the 11 to 14 and 15 to 18year age groups were significantly higher than lrc standard values 169 and 172 vs 160 and 159 mgdl respectively p  005 this difference was also significant in boys 167 and 168 vs 160 and 153 mgdl respectively at the p  005 level a significant linear association was shown between adolescents dyslipidemia and the frequency of intake of hydrogenated fat fast foods cheese puffs and potato chips p  005 although the protein intake was lower than the rda 134  09 vs 15 p  005 because of the highly prevalent consumption of fatty lamb meat the frequency of red meat intake had a direct association with dyslipidernia p  005 conclusion the improper intake of high amounts of saturated fat and the observed serum lipid profile of iranian adolescents are likely placing them at increased risk for cardiovascular disease cvd and necessitate developing guidelines and communitybased interventions c 2004 the institute for cancer prevention and elsevier inc all rights reserved
the objective of the study is to investigate the effect of a comprehensive community trial on behavioral modification after 2 years of intervention the interventions of this 6year comprehensive communitybased study target the whole population of nearly 2 i 80 000 living in 2 cities in iran and are compared with another iranian city considered as reference educational environmental and legislative interventions are being conducted at the population level from the baseline to the second year of evaluation of this study the consumption of hydrogenated fat decreased significantly in the intervention community but it remained nearly constant in the reference area meanwhile the consumption of liquid oil increased in the intervention community whereas it decreased in the reference area the prevalence of current smoking and attempt to smoke decreased respectively in men and youths living in the intervention area but increased or remained constant in the reference area however no favorable change was seen for smoking among women leisure time physical activity increased in women and declined in men of both communities the slopes of these changes were greater in the intervention area although the consumption of saltyfat snacks slightly decreased in the school students of the intervention area it had a sharp increase in the reference area this program succeeded in improving some aspects of lifestyle in its different target groups the authors suggest that the synergy of activities intensified the dose of interventions and led to this improvement
as sitosterolemic patients have an increased cardiovascular risk there is concern that reducing serum ldlcholesterol concentrations by plant sterols enriched functional foods might adversely affect vascular function whether increased concentrations of plant sterols truly affect vascular function and whether these effects are exclusive to the larger vessels remains unknown we compared the effects of longterm plant sterol and stanol consumption on changes in retinal vessels diameter which reflex alterations in the microcirculation three randomized groups were studied at baseline and after 85weeks group one n  11 consumed plant sterol enriched margarine 25 gday the second n8 plant stanol enriched margarine 25 gday and the control group n  11 nonenriched margarine 25 gday serum cholesterolstandardized campesterol and sitosterol concentrations increased by 35484  16822102 mu molmmol and 8436  4826102 mu molmmol p  0001 respectively in the sterol group while decreasing nonsignificantly in the plant stanol group serum ldlcholesterol concentrations decreased significantly in both the plant sterol 033  033 mmoll p  0016 and stanol groups 038  034 mmoll p  0018 compared to the increase in the controls 029  034 mmoll the mean change in venular diameters for the plant sterol group 23  31 mu m plant stanol groups 08  34 mu m and control group 08  51 mu m did not reach significance but the change in cholesterolstandardized campesterol concentrations correlated positively with the change in venular diameter independent of changes in serum ldlcholesterol concentrations r  039 n  30 p  0033 increased serum campesterol concentration correlated positively with increased retinal venular diameter independent from changes in serum ldlcholesterol concentrations this may constitute an explanation for the suggested effects of plant sterols on vascular function however this novel finding needs confirmation and further study c 2010 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
we studied the concentrations and ratios to cholesterol of noncholesterol sterols reflecting absorption eg campesterol or synthesis eg lathosterol of cholesterol off and on plant sterol and stanol ester spreads in serum and in different lipoproteins of a family with familial hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous parents receiving no treatment and their homozygous offspring undergoing longterm treatment with statins and apheresis serum cholesterol levels were similar in the homozygous and heterozygous individuals but the concentrations of sterols reflecting cholesterol absorption were as much as 10 times greater in the homozygous child than in the heterozygous parents whereas the respective markers of cholesterol synthesis only tended to be higher about 70 of squalene in the homozygous individual 60 in the heterozygous family members and 85 to 90 of noncholesterol sterols 6080 in the heterozygous subjects were transported by lowdensity lipoprotein the ratios of absorption sterols to cholesterol were higher in highdensity lipoprotein hdl than in very lowdensity lipoprotein vldl whereas those of synthesis markers and plant stanols were highest in vldl the ratios of absorption sterols in serum were mostly lower than those in hdl but higher than in vldl whereas the ratios of synthesis sterols in serum were lower than they were in vldl both spreads reduced serum total cholesterol by about 14 in the heterozygous family members and 9 in the homozygous individual the sterol ester spread increased serum plant sterol concentrations eg campesterol in the homozygous family member increased from 5 to 9 mgdl and the ratios to cholesterol but the stanol ester spread decreased them plant sterol esters seemed to similarly decrease serum cholesterol in this family with familial hypercholesterolemia but the clinical role of increased plant sterol concentrations almost doubled in the ldl of homozygous individuals is not known

khatoon s and s r y reddy 2005 plastic fats with zero trans fatty acids by interesterification of mango mahua and palm oils european journal of lipid science and technology 10711 786791
speciality plastic fats with no trans fatty acids suitable for use in bakery and as vanaspati are prepared by interesterification of blends of palm hard fraction pst with mahua and mango fats at various proportions it was found that the interesterified samples did not show significant differences in solid fat content sfc after 05 or 1 h reaction time the blends containing pstmahua 11 showed three distinct endotherms indicating a heterogeneity of triacylglycerols tg the proportions of which altered after interesterification the sfc also showed improved plasticity after interesterification similar results were observed with other blends of pstmahua 12 these changes in melting behavior are due to alterations in tg composition as the trisaturatedtype tg were reduced and the lowmelting tg increased after interesterification the blends containing pstmango 11 showed improvement in plasticity after interesterification whereas those containing pstmango 21 were hard and showed high solid contents at higher temperature and hence may not be suitable for bakery or as vanaspati the blends with palm and mahua oils were softer and may be suitable for margarinetype products the results showed that the blends of pst mahua 11 12 and pstmango 11 after interesterification for 1 h at 80 degrees c showed an sfc similar to those of commercial hydrogenated bakery shortenings and vanaspati hence they could be used in these applications in place of hydrogenated fats as they are free from trans acids which are reported to be risk factors involved in coronary heart disease for softer consistency like margarine applications the blends containing palm oil and mahua oil are suitable

trans fatty acids tfa are geometrical isomers of unsaturated fatty acids that assume a saturated fatty acidlike configuration human diets contain tfa derived from animal sources eg dairy products and ruminant meats but most are supplied by products containing industrially hydrogenated vegetable oils  eg margarines shortenings and baked goods typical intake of tfa in american diets has been estimated to be between 815 gday although wide variation exists between individuals human clinical studies since 1990 have revealed that relative to cismonounsaturated fatty acids ie oleic acid tfa increase total cholesterol tc and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc and tend to decrease high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc concentrations additionally tfa tend to increase the atherogenic lipoprotein a thus tfa induce an adverse plasma lipid profile increased ratios of tcldlc and ldlchdlc which represents increased risk for coronary heart disease the effects of tfa on ldlc and hdlc appear to be directly related to intake and clinically measurable above 3en as tfa the cholesterolraising ability of tfa is analogous to that of the 1216 carbon saturated fatty acids possibly reflecting increased ldl production or delayed ldl clearance by contrast tfa are unlike the saturated fatty acids in their depression of hdlc preliminary evidence suggests that at least part of their impact on lipoproteins reflects increased serum cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity ie increased transfer of cholesteryl esters from hdl to ldl since the adverse effects of tfa on human plasma lipids may be confined to specific isomers future studies delineating their effects are warranted
structured lipids sls for formulating transfree margarines were synthesized by lipasecatalyzed interesterification of the blends of canola oil co palm stearin ps and palm kernel oil pko in weight ratios copspko of 40600 405010 404020 403030 503020 and 602515 the atherogenicity was determined using fatty acid profiles we also determined the physical properties meltingcrystallization profiles solid fat content polymorphism and microstructure of sls and the textural properties of margarines made with the sls the sls from the 503020 and 602515 blends had atherogenic indices similar to or lower than those of the commercial trans ctmf and similar to the transfree margarine fats ctfmf sls from the blends with pko contained a wide range of fatty acids c6c20 and had more beta than beta polymorphs margarines made with sls from 503020 and 602515 blends possessed similar hardness adhesiveness or cohesiveness to margarines made with ctmf and ctfmf respectively therefore copspkobased sls were suitable for formulating transfree margarines with low atherogenicity and desirable textural properties
biomarkers of transfatty acid consumption have been associated with increased risks of breast and colon cancer although no studies have examined their associations with prostate cancer risk using data from the betacarotene and retinol efficacy trial this nested casecontrol study examined the relationships between serum phospholipid transfatty acids and prostate cancer incidence in 272 case and 426 control men transfatty acids were measured using organic extraction followed by separations with tlc and gas chromatography adjusted odds ratios for risk of prostate cancer with increasing levels of transfatty acids were calculated using logistic regression there were consistent trends for increasing prostate cancer risk with higher levels of c18 but not c16 transfatty acids although only trends for am 181 transvaccenic and delta 9c12t 182 fatty acids reached statistical significance odds ratios 95 confidence interval contrasting low versus high quartiles for these fatty acids were 169 103277 and 179 102315 respectively there were no consistent differences in associations between lowgrade and highgrade cancer among the subset of 209 cases with information on tumor grade additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and better control for factors such as use of prostatespecific antigen screening which may confound this association

the major use of the ten billion pounds or so of soybean oil produced in the us is for food products such as cooking oils shortenings and margarines refined bleached and deodorized red soybean oil used for cooking is usually hydrogenated to increase storage life and stability during frying red soybean oil is also extensively hydrogenated to increase melting point for functionality in shortenings and margarines hydrogenation results in oils rich in trans fatty acids the consumption of which may be associated with coronary heart disease red oils used for salad oils are not hydrogenated but are rich in palmitic acid the consumption of which has also been associated with coronary heart disease therefore it is nutritionally desirable to produce transfree soybean oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids with reduced palmitic acid for cooking and soybean oils with no saturated fatty acids for salad oils it is also desirable to produce transfree oils rich in stearic and oleic acids for shortenings and margarines cloned genes may be introduced into soybeans to create transgenic lines with improved oil traits the design of transgene constructs has been assisted by the use of soybean somatic embryos in suspension culture as a model system for soybean seed transformation this system has allowed the selection of the right genes and promoters to achieve the desired phenotypes in transgenic soybeans current soybeans in development include lines producing oil with reduced palmitic acid lines with over 80 oleic acid and lines with up to 30 stearic acid commercialization of high oleic acid transgenic soybeans has demonstrated that it is possible to drastically alter the fatty acid composition of a soybean seed without affecting the yield or environmental sensitivity of the soybean plant

the major uses of soybean oils worldwide are for food products such as frying oils shortenings and margarine refined soybean oil is usually chemically hydrogenated to increase storage life stability during frying and to increase its melting point for use in solid fat applications hydrogenation results in the formation of monounsaturated trans fatty acids the consumption of which has been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease in humans it is nutritionally desirable therefore to produce transfree soybean oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids for cooking and transfree oils rich in stearic and oleic acids for shortenings and margarine cloned genes may be introduced into soybeans to create transgenic lines with improved oil traits the design of transgene constructs has been assisted by the use of soybean somatic embryos in suspension culture as a model system for soybean seed transformation this system has allowed the selection of the right genes and promoters to achieve the desired phenotypes in transgenic soybeans by manipulating the expression of fatty acid desaturase genes we have produced lines with 85 oleic acid in their seed oil and lines with up to 30 stearic acid commercialization of higholeic acid transgenic soybeans has demonstrated that it is possible to drastically alter the fatty acid composition of a soybean seed without affecting the yield or environmental sensitivity of the soybean plant we have demonstrated that higholeic soybean oil is also useful for nonfood applications such as biodegradable lubricants we have now cloned a number of fatty acid desaturaserelated genes from species which produce unusual and industrially useful fatty acids by expressing these genes it will be possible to produce new fatty acids in soybean seeds which could potentially replace petrochemicals as raw material for many industrial processes
kliem k e 2009 improving the nutritional quality of milk optimising milk fatty acid profile by manipulating the dairy cow diet agro food industry hitech 205 811
epidemiological evidence suggests high milk consumption protects against certain chronic diseases and yet the high saturated fatty acid sfa concentration of milk fat has lead to research into reducing sfa and trans fatty acid content and enhancing conjugated linoleic acid cla content the most successful method of reducing sfa content is by feeding dairy cows supplemental oilseeds although amount type and form of oilseed influence the degree of effect also the high unsaturated fatty acid content of oilseeds leads to increases in milk fat trans fatty acids unless the oilseed is protected from rumen metabolism milk fat cla concentrations can be increased by feeding fish oils however this can also lead to increases in trans fatty acids trans fatty acids are thought to have negative effects on human health although the consumption and isomeric profile of ruminantderived trans fatty acids are different to consumption and profile of those derived from industrial hydrogenation future research should be directed towards sustainable methods of supplementing dairy cow diets with plant ads in a way that produces the most beneficial milk fatty acid profile
clinical and biomedical studies have provided evidence for the critical role of n3 fatty acids on the reduction of chronic disease risk in humans including cardiovascular disease in the current experiment the potential to enhance milk n3 content in two breeds with inherent genetic differences in mammary lipogenesis and de novo fatty acid synthesis was examined using extruded linseeds six lactating cows three holstein and three jersey were used in a twotreatment switchback design with 3 x 21day experimental periods to evaluate the effect of isoenergetic replacement of calcium salts of palm oil distillate cpo in the diet 34 gkg dry matter dm with 100 gkg dm extruded linseeds lin for both breeds replacing cpo with lin had no effect p  005 on dm intake or milk yield but reduced p  005 milk fat and protein yield on average from 760 to 706 and 573 to 552 gday respectively relative to cpo the lin treatment reduced p  001 total saturated fatty acid content and enhanced p  0001 183n3 in milk whereas breed by diet interactions were significant for milk fat 160 total trans fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid concentrations increases in 183n3 intake derived from lin in the diet were transferred into milk with a mean marginal transfer efficiency of 18 proportionate changes in milk fatty acid composition were greater in the jersey highlighting the importance of dietgenotype interactions on mammary lipogenesis more extensive studies are required to determine the role of genotype on milk fat composition responses to oilseeds in the diet
in most western countries saturated fatty acid sfa intake exceeds recommended levels which is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease cvd as milk and dairy products are major contributors to sfa intake in many countries recent research has focused on sustainable methods of producing milk with a lower saturated fat concentration by altering dairy cow diets human intervention studies have shown that cvd risk can be reduced by consuming dairy products with reduced sfa and increased cismonounsaturated fatty acid mufa concentrations this milk fatty acid profile can be achieved by supplementing dairy cow diets with cismufarich unsaturated oils however rumen exposure of unsaturated oils also leads to enhanced milk trans fatty acid tfa concentrations because of concerns about the effects of tfa consumption on cvd feeding strategies that increase mufa concentrations in milk without concomitant increases in tfa concentration are preferred by milk processors in an attempt to limit tfa production and increase the replacement of sfa by cismufa a preparation of rumenprotected unsaturated oils was developed using saponification with calcium salts four multiparous holsteinfriesian cows in midlate lactation were used in a 4 x 4 latin square design with 21d periods to investigate the effect of incremental dietary inclusion of a calcium salt of cismufa product camufa 20 40 and 60 gkg of dry matter of a maize silagebased diet on milk production composition and fatty acid concentration increasing camufa inclusion reduced dry matter intake linearly but no change was observed in estimated me intake no change in milk yield was noted but milk fat and protein concentrations were linearly reduced supplementation with camufa resulted in a linear reduction in total spa from 71 to 52 g100 g of fatty acids for control and 60 gkg of dry matter diets respectively in addition concentrations of both cis and transmufa were increased with camufa inclusion and increases in other biohydrogenation intermediates in milk fat were also observed the camufa supplement was very effective at reducing milk spa concentration and increasing cismufa concentrations without incurring any negative effects on milk and milk component yields however reduced milk fat and protein concentrations together with increases in milk tfa concentrations suggest partial dissociation of the calcium salts in the rumen
based on potential benefits to human health there is increasing interest in altering the composition of ruminantderived foods including rapeseeds in the dairy cow diet is an effective strategy for replacing mediumchain saturated fatty acids sfa with cismonounsaturated fatty acids mufa in bovine milk but there is limited information on the optimum level of supplementation decreases in sfa due to plant oils are also accompanied by increases in milk trans fatty acid fa content and it is possible that high oleic acid rapeseeds may result in a higher enrichment of cis9 181 and lower increases in trans fas in milk compared with conventional varieties seven multiparous lactating holsteinfriesian cows were allocated to one of seven treatments in an incomplete latin square design with five 28day experimental periods to evaluate the effect of replacing calcium salts of palm oil distillate cpo 41 gkg diet dry matter dm with 128 168 or 207 gkg diet dm of conventional cor or a high oleic acid hor rapeseed fed as a supplement milled with wheat rapeseed variety and inclusion level had no effect p  005 on dm intake milk yield and composition both rapeseed varieties decreased linearly p  0001 milk fat sfa content which was partially compensated for by a linear increase p  0001 in cis9 181 concentration reductions in milk sfa were also associated with increases p  005 in trans 181 and total trans fa content with no difference p  005 between rapeseed varieties replacing cpo in the diet with milled rapeseeds had no effect p  005 on total milk conjugated linoleic acid cla concentration relative to a cor inclusion of a high oleic acid variant in the diet increased p  001 the ratio of transmufa transpolyunsaturated fatty acids in milk that may have implications with respect to cardiovascular disease risk in humans in conclusion data indicated that replacing cpo with milled rapeseeds at levels up to 1150 g oilday could be used as a nutritional strategy to lower milk sfa content without inducing adverse effects on dm intake and milk production hor reduced milk fat sfa content to a greater extent than a conventional variety but did not minimise associated increases in trans fa concentrations however the high oleic acid variant did alter the relative abundance of specific trans 181 cla and trans 182 isomers compared with conventional rapeseeds
milk and dairy products are major sources of fat in the human diet but there are few detailed reports on the fatty acid composition of retail milk trans fatty acids in particular and how these change throughout the year semiskimmed milk was collected monthly for one year from five supermarkets and analysed for fatty acid composition relative to winter milk sold in the summer contained lower total saturated fatty acid sfa 67 vs 72 g100 g fatty acids and higher cismonounsaturated fatty acid mufa 23 vs 21 g100 g fatty acids and total trans fatty acid 65 vs 45 g100 g fatty acids concentrations concentrations of most trans181 and 182 isomers also exhibited seasonal variation results were applied to national dietary intakes and indicated that monthly variation in the fatty acid composition of milk available at retail has limited influence on total dietary fatty acid consumption by uk adults c 2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
transfatty acids tfas products of partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils have become more prevalent in our diet since the 1960s when they replaced animal fats tfas also occur naturally in meat and dairy products from ruminants there is growing evidence that dietary transfatty acids may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome several studies have demonstrated adverse effects of tfas on plasma lipids and lipoproteins in dietary trials transfatty acids have been shown to raise the total cholesterolhdl cholesterol ratio and lpa levels in blood moreover a high intake of tfas has been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease prospective cohort studies have shown that dietary transfatty acids promote abdominal obesity and weight gain in addition it appears that tfa consumption may be associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes the documented adverse health effects of tfas emphasise the importance of efforts to reduce the content of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils in foods
to explore whether the metabolic responses to trans compared with cis fatty acids depend on the source of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa male spraguedawley rats 5 weeks old were fed on diets containing 30 g oleic cis or elaidic trans acidskg in combination with either 70 g perilla oil alphalinolenic acid or safflowerseed oil linoleic acidkg for 3 weeks in separate experiments the dietary fats were adjusted to have the same level of total pufa the dietary manipulation did not influence the growth indices but spleen weight was greater when the dietary pufa source was perilla oil the incorporation of trans fatty acid into liver phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine and adipose tissue lipids particularly phospholipids was significantly higher when rats were fed on safflowerseed oil compared with perilla oil however only limited differences were observed in the effects of cis and trans fatty acids on the proportions of pufa in liver phospholipids splenic production of prostaglandin e2 was reduced by trans fatty acid when safflowerseed oil was the pufa source but no trans effect was observed on leukotriene c4 production dietary pufa significantly influenced the concentration of plasma immunoglobulins ig but the effect of geometry was only seen in igg which was increased by trans acid dietary trans fatty acid increased the cd4cd8 tlymphocyte ratio in the spleen reflecting a decreasing trend of the proportion of cd8 when combined with perilla oil these observations indicate that the type of pufa simultaneously ingested specifically influences the effect that trans acid exerts on pufa metabolism eicosanoid production and some immune indices

consumption of transfatty acids increased markedly during this century due to the widespread use of partially hydrogenated fats a sensitive analytical method was developed which enables the precise determination of 7 transisomers in small sample volumes with this method we documented the maternofetal transfer of transfatty acids across the human placenta the content in human milk depends on maternal diet and is lower in germany than in the sudan the distribution in fore and hindmilk in milk fat fractions and within the triglyceride molecule was determined the content of transfatty acids is lower in commercial and homemade infant formulae than in human milk although there is a certain batch to batch variation in formulae infants absorb dietary transisomers and incorporate them into endogenous lipids subcutaneous tissue and cell membranes transfatty acids in plasma lipids are significantly higher in infants fed human milk than in those fed formulae african children have a lower exposure than germans the relative contribution of transoctadecenoic acid is lower in plasma sterolesters than in triglycerides and phospholipids pointing to a negative selectivity of plasmatic cholesterol esterification with this fatty acid thus a high supply of transoctadecenoic acid might have negative effects on the cholesterol levels in premature infants we found an inverse correlation between transfatty acid exposure and birthweight thus interference with intrauterine growth appears possible a possible causative factor could be impaired biosynthesis of longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids by transisomers for which we found strong indications the results of our investigations the question whether the consumption of transfatty acids in pregnant and lactating women and in infants is nutritionally safe

the consumption of trans isomers of unsaturated fatty acids has been associated with untoward metabolic effects several clinical investigations demonstrated that trans fatty acids increase plasma ldlcholesterol and lipoprotein a and reduce hdlcholesterol concentrations these alterations of plasma lipid profiles indicate an atherogenic effect of trans fatty acids both in preterm infants and in healthy children aged 115 years we found blood plasma arachidonic acid c204 omega6 levels and the productsubstrate ratios of arachidonic acid synthesis c204 omega6c182 omega6 inversely correlated to the level of the principal trans fatty acid trans octadecaenoic acid c181 omega97 trans which is compatible with a dosedependent inhibition of arachidonic acid synthesis by trans fatty acids moreover in premature infants trans fatty acids in blood plasma correlated inversely with birth weight in an observational study indicating that trans fatty acids may impair early human growth it appears desirable to limit the dietary intake of trans fatty acids the major dietary sources of trans fatty acids are partially hydrogenated vegetable and fish oils refinement of the industrial technology of partial hydrogenation and appropriate food labelling may lead to a considerably decrease of human exposure to trans fatty acids
sterols are basic components of cell membranes in animal and plant organisms so far almost 40 types of plant sterols have been identified and among them the most known and the most commonly occurring are betasitosterol kampesterol and stigmasterol stanols constitute their saturated type obtained during the hydrogenation of sterols phytosterols are natural plant components of for example soybeans plant oils rice and pine wood small amounts of phytosterols are also in nuts vegetables and fruits an adequate measured quantity of plant sterols is able to essentially reduce the cholesterol level in blood the mechanism of their activity consists in decreasing the intestinal absorption of cholesterol by replacing it in micelles extensive clinical research projects showed that a dose of 2  3 g sterols per day caused the level of total cholesterol to be reduced by about 10  and the ldl fraction to be decreased by ca 15  the intake of those compounds reduces the risk of heart attack and prevents atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease therefore plant sterols are more and more often added to food products among other things to margarines oils yogurts ripening cheeses bakery products muesli juices and fruit beverages

background monounsaturated fatty acids mufas like oleic acid have been shown to cause apoptosis of cultured endothelial cells by activating protein phosphatase type 2c alpha and beta pp2c the question arises whether damage of endothelial or other cells could be observed in intact animals fed with a trioleateenriched diet methodologyprincipal findings dunkinhartley guinea pigs were fed with a trioleateenriched diet for 5 months advanced atherosclerotic changes of the aorta and the coronary arteries could not be seen but the arteries appeared in a preatherosclerotic stage of vascular remodelling however the weight and size of the hearts were lower than in controls and the number of apoptotic myocytes increased in the hearts of trioleatefed animals to confirm the idea that oleic acid may have caused this apoptosis by activation of pp2c cultured cardiomyocytes from guinea pigs and mice were treated with various lipids it was demonstrable that oleic acid dosedependently caused apoptosis of cardiomyocytes from both species yet similar to previous experiments with cultured neurons and endothelial cells stearic acid elaidic acid and oleic acid methylester did not the apoptotic effect caused by oleic acid was diminished when pp2c alpha and beta were downregulated by sirna showing that pp2c was causally involved in apoptosis caused by oleic acid conclusionssignificance the glycerol trioleate diet given to guinea pigs for 5 months did not cause marked atherosclerosis but clearly damaged the hearts by activating pp2c alpha and beta the diet used with 24 wtwt glycerol trioleate is not comparable to human diets the detrimental role of mufas for guinea pig heart tissue in vivo is shown for the first time whether it is true for humans remains to be shown
bioactive compounds are extranutritional constituents that typically occur in small quantities in foods they are being intensively studied to evaluate their effects on health the impetus sparking this scientific inquiry was the result of many epidemiologic studies that have shown protective effects of plantbased diets on cardiovascular disease cvd and cancer many bioactive compounds have been discovered these compounds vary widely in chemical structure and function and are grouped accordingly phenolic compounds including their subcategory flavonoids are present in all plants and have been studied extensively in cereals legumes nuts olive oil vegetables fruits tea and red wine many phenolic compounds have antioxidant properties and some studies have demonstrated favorable effects on thrombosis and tumorogenesis and promotion although some epidemiologic studies have reported protective associations between flavonoids or other phenolics and cvd and cancer other studies have not found these associations various phytoestrogens are present in soy but also in flaxseed oil whole grains fruits and vegetables they have antioxidant properties and some studies demonstrated favorable effects on other cvd risk factors and in animal and cell culture models of cancer however because phytoestrogens act both as partial estrogen agonists and antagonists their effects on cancer are likely complex hydroxytyrosol one of many phenolics in olives and olive oil is a potent antioxidant resveratrol found in nuts and red wine has antioxidant antithrombotic and antiinflammatory properties and inhibits carcinogenesis lycopene a potent antioxidant carotenoid in tomatoes and other fruits is thought to protect against prostate and other cancers and inhibits tumor cell growth in animals organosulfur compounds in garlic and onions isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables and monoterpenes in citrus fruits cherries and herbs have anticarcinogenic actions in experimental models as well as cardioprotective effects in summary numerous bioactive compounds appear to have beneficial health effects much scientific research needs to be conducted before we can begin to make sciencebased dietary recommendations despite this there is sufficient evidence to recommend consuming food sources rich in bioactive compounds from a practical perspective this translates torecommending a diet rich in a variety of fruits vegetables whole grains legumes oils and nuts c 2002 by excerpta medica inc

the major source of trans unsaturated fatty acid bearing fats trans fats is the partially hydrogenated fats present in margarines salad and cooking oils when ingested trans fats are deposited in tissues but disappear when the nutritional stimulus is removed they have no adverse effects on growth or reproduction in rats trans fats are hypercholesterolemic for rabbits and monkeys but no more atherogenic than their cis counterparts in man trans fats elevate cholesterol but the extent of elevation may depend on the level of dietary linoleic acid in some but not all studies they elevate lpa the difference may reflect the presence of specific trans isomers  an area that merits further studies tissue of subjects with coronary disease contain no more trans fatty acids than those of controls reviews of the literature by expert committees in the us and uk conclude that at current levels of intake dietary trans fats pose no health problems however more research is needed especially with regard to pregnancy lactation and neonatal health current concerns should not deflect our attention from the larger aspects of fat and health

phytosterols have been used as blood cholesterollowering agents for the last half century they have been shown to be effective and safe originally presented as a pharmaceutical formulation phytosterols are now being added to an increasing variety of foodstuffs on occasion questions have arisen concerning their safety but at the present time and at the current level of usage no adverse effects have been observed c 2005 elsevier inc all rights reserved
trans fatty acid intake has been correlated to an unfavorable plasma lipoprotein profile and an increased cardiovascular disease risk the present study aimed to identify a plasma protein biomarker panel related to human intake of elaidic acid the human liver cell line hepg2sf was used as a model system and the cells were maintained for seven days in serumfree medium containing 100 mu m elaidic acid trans delta 9c181 oleic acid cis delta 9c181 or stearic acid c180 the secretomes were analyzed by stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture silac difference in gel electrophoresis dige and gene expression microarray analysis twelve proteins were found to be differentially regulated based on silac data 13 fold change pvalue 005 13 proteins were found to be differentially regulated based on dige analysis 13 fold change pvalue 005 and 17 mrna transcripts encoding extracellular proteins were determined to be affected 13 fold change pvalue 001 following the addition of elaidic acid compared to oleic acid or stearic acid the results revealed that 37 proteins were regulated specifically in response to elaidic acid exposure and nine of these proteins were confirmed to be regulated in this manner by using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry c 2012 elsevier bv all rights reserved
objectivewe carried out a secondary analysis in highrisk patients with a previous myocardial infarction mi and diabetes in the alpha omega trial we tested the hypothesis that in these patients an increased intake of the n3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa docosahexaenoic acid dha and alphalinolenic acid ala will reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and fatal mi research design and methodsa subgroup of 1014 postmi patients with diabetes aged 6080 years was randomly allocated to receive one of four trial margarines three with an additional amount of n3 fatty acids and one placebo for 40 months the end points were ventricular arrhythmia related events and fatal mi the data were analyzed according to the intentiontotreat principle using multivariable cox proportional hazards models resultsthe patients consumed on average 186 g of margarine per day which resulted in an additional intake of 223 mg epa plus 149 mg dha andor 19 g ala in the active treatment groups during followup 29 patients developed a ventricular arrhythmia related events and 27 had a fatal mi compared with placebo patients the epadha plus ala group experienced less ventricular arrhythmia related events hazard ratio 016 95 cl 004069 these n3 fatty acids also reduced the combined endpoint ventricular arrhythmia related events and fatal mi 028 011071 conclusionsour results suggest that lowdose supplementation of n3 fatty acids exerts a protective effect against ventricular arrhythmia related events in postmi patients with diabetes
background results from prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials have provided evidence of a protective effect of n3 fatty acids against cardiovascular diseases we examined the effect of the marine n3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha and of the plantderived alphalinolenic acid ala on the rate of cardiovascular events among patients who have had a myocardial infarction methods in a multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled trial we randomly assigned 4837 patients 60 through 80 years of age 78 men who had had a myocardial infarction and were receiving stateoftheart antihypertensive antithrombotic and lipidmodifying therapy to receive for 40 months one of four trial margarines a margarine supplemented with a combination of epa and dha with a targeted additional daily intake of 400 mg of epadha a margarine supplemented with ala with a targeted additional daily intake of 2 g of ala a margarine supplemented with epadha and ala or a placebo margarine the primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events which comprised fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and cardiac interventions data were analyzed according to the intentiontotreat principle with the use of cox proportionalhazards models results the patients consumed on average 188 g of margarine per day which resulted in additional intakes of 226 mg of epa combined with 150 mg of dha 19 g of ala or both in the activetreatment groups during the followup period a major cardiovascular event occurred in 671 patients 139 neither epadha nor ala reduced this primary end point hazard ratio with epadha 101 95 confidence interval ci 087 to 117 p  093 hazard ratio with ala 091 95 ci 078 to 105 p  020 in the prespecified subgroup of women ala as compared with placebo and epadha alone was associated with a reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events that approached significance hazard ratio 073 95 ci 051 to 103 p  007 the rate of adverse events did not differ significantly among the study groups conclusions lowdose supplementation with epadha or ala did not significantly reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events among patients who had had a myocardial infarction and who were receiving stateoftheart antihypertensive antithrombotic and lipidmodifying therapy
background in the seven countries study associations between intake of individual fatty acids and dietary cholesterol were studied in relation to serum cholesterol and 25year mortality from coronary heart disease all analyses concern only intercohort comparisons methods in the baseline surveys carried out between 1958 and 1964 risk factors for coronary heart disease were measured among 12763 middleaged men constituting 16 cohorts in seven countries in 1987 and 1988 equivalent food composites representing the average food intake of each cohort at baseline were collected locally and analyzed in a central laboratory the vital status of all participants was verified at regular intervals during 25 years of followup results of the individual saturated fatty acids the average population intake of lauric and myristic acid was most strongly related to the average serum cholesterol level r  08 p  0001 strong positive associations were observed between 25year death rates from coronary heart disease and average intake of the four major saturated fatty acids lauric myristic palmitic and stearic acid r  08 p  0001 the trans fatty acid elaidic acid r  078 p  0001 and dietary cholesterol r  055 p  005 conclusions interpreted in the light of experimental and clinical studies the results of these crosscultural analyses suggest that dietary saturated and trans fatty acids and dietary cholesterol are important determinants of differences in population rates of coronary heart disease death c 1995 academic press inc
transfatty acid intake is associated with an increased risk of chd and diabetes the effects of single transfatty acid isomers are largely unexplored the present study examined the effects of a 6week supplementation with two trans181 isomers trans i i and trans 12 in human subjects on immune cells several inflammatory and immunological biomarkers for example il tnf alpha creactive protein adiponectin intercellular adhesion molecule1 prostacyclin phagocytic process following a 2week adaptation period without supplements the test group n 12 received vaccenic acid trans11181 and trans12181 in equal amounts 60 gd for 6 weeks the control group n 12 consumed an oil without transfatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids cla samples were collected at the end of both periods trans11and trans1218 i were significantly increased in cellular lipids the endogenous synthesis of cis9 trans11cla from trans11181 was demonstrated via increased cla in cellular lipids of the test group generally transisomer supplementation did not affect either inflammatory biomarkers for example il6 il8 tnf alpha or immune function for example phagocytosis during the present study the dietary supplementation of trans11 and trans12181 6gd and their accumulation in leucocytes had no effects on biomarkers of inflammation and immune function however because of the limited data on the safety of transfatty acid intake and effects of individual trans isomers on human health for example trans918  1 trans 10181 at present it is prudent to reduce transfat intake in general
background high consumption of trans fat has been associated with high oxidative stress in humans which could increase the risk of the development or acceleration of several diseases such as atherosclerosis cancer and type 2 diabetes objective several urinary and blood biomarkers of oxidative stress 8isoprostaglandinf2alpha pgf2 alpha 15ketodihydropgf2 alpha and 78dihydro8oxo2deoxyguanosine in urine and alpha beta gamma deltatocopherol and retinol in plasma were monitored to evaluate the oxidative stress induced by dietary supplementation of 11trans and 12trans181 isomers in humans during a 6wk intervention design after a 14d adaptation period free of trans fatty acid supplementation baseline the test group n  12 received 30 g 11trans181d and 30 g 12trans181d sigma 60 gd and the control group n  12 consumed a control oil free of trans fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids for 6 wk results the postintervention concentration of urinary 8isopgf2 alpha free radicalinduced lipid peroxidation in the test group was significantly higher than baseline and significantly higher than that observed in the control group the concentrations of 15ketodihydropgf2 alpha cyclooxygenasemediated inflammatory response indicator and 78dihydro8oxo2deoxyguanosine oxidative dna damage were not affected by the 11trans and 12trans181 supplementation conclusions although an increase in urinary 8isopgf2 alpha was observed and the effects of prolonged high ie  50 gd consumption of trans fat could be relevant to the development of disease the mean intakes of 11trans and 12trans181 in europeans are estimated to be significantly below the amounts administered in this study ie 60 gd such low intakes could minimize the possible risk of detrimental effects on human health

kummerow f a 2009 the negative effects of hydrogenated trans fats and what to do about them atherosclerosis 2052 458465
partially hydrogenated vegetable oils have been in the american diet since 1900 more than 50 years ago they were found to contain trans fatty acids that were different from natural fatty acids in plant oils and in animal fat there was growing evidence that the consumption of trans fats have negative health effects including increasing plasma lipid levels in 2003 the food and drug administration fda ruled that the amount of trans fat in a food item must be stated on the label after january 1 2006 food items could be labeled 0 trans if they contain less than 05 gserving since the initial ruling it is now known that the fatty acids in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil are 14 cis and trans isomers of octadecenoic and octadecadienoic acids that are formed during hydrogenation they cause inflammation and calcification of arterial cells known risk factors for coronary heart disease chd they inhibit cyclooxygenase an enzyme required for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostacyclin necessary for the regulation of blood flow there have been several reformulations of hydrogenated fat containing varying amounts of trans fatty acids and linoleic acid an essential fatty acid that is converted to arachidonic acid epidemiological data suggest that when trans fat percentages go up and linoleic acid percentages go down death rates rise when trans goes down death rates go down in spite of the harmful effects of trans fats the fda allows it in the food supply as long as the amount in a food item is declared on the label trans fat should be banned from the food supply c 2009 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
plasma lipids obtained from swine which had been fed butter or margarine at two dietary magnesium mg levels indicated that the level of dietary mg was more significant to plasma total cholesterol tc lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc levels than was the presence of butter or margarine at 270 mg mgkg which is considered adequate for swine there was a significant difference in the plasma tc between swine fed margarine and those fed butterfat 105 and 126 mg  respectively plasma ldlc was higher in swine fed butter than in those fed margarine 88 and 71 mg  respectively in swine fed an additional 247 mg mgkg however there was no significant difference in plasma tc between those fed margarine or butter although at 247 mg mgkg plasma ldlc was higher in swine fed margarine and hdlc was higher in those fed butter there were no significant differences in the order parameters of ldl and hdl studies in which the influences of dietary fats on plasma cholesterol were first noted were carried out on liquid diets deficient in mg mg a cofactor in the enzymes involved in desaturation of saturated fatty acids is also necessary in desaturation of linoleic to arachidonic acid
our hypothesis that the trans fatty acids in hydrogenated fat inhibited the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the phospholipid of arterial cells was tested with five groups each with six pregnant porcine fed from d 35 of gestation and during lactation the basal diet contained 2 corn oil control the other four diets included the control  10 butter or 10 hydrogenated fat plus two levels of mg plasma milk and aortic phospholipid fatty acids phospholipid composition and calcium content of the aorta from the piglets were determined at 48  2 d of age the aorta phospholipid of piglets from porcine fed hydrogenated fat contained a significantly higher concentration of linoleic acid less arachidonic acid and less long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa than did piglets from porcine fed either butterfat or the control diet mg had no effect these changes in composition in piglets from porcine fed hydrogenated fat indicate that trans fat inhibits the metabolic conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid and to other n6 pufa the aortic calcium content data showed a significant interaction of calcium concentration with age we concluded 1 that dietary trans fat perturbed essential fatty acid efa metabolism which led to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta the target tissue of atherogenesis 2 this inhibition of efa to pufa by the isomeric fatty acids in hydrogenated fat is a risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease c 2004 elsevier inc all rights reserved

background in russia rapid changes have taken place both in total and chronic disease mortality during recent years little reliable information is available on the trends in conventional risk factors in russia methods chronic disease risk factors and health behaviours were studied in the republic of karelia russia in 1992 and 1997 in population surveys connected with the national finrisk study in finland independent random population samples n1000 of people aged between 25 and 64 years were drawn in both survey years surveys included a selfadministered questionnaire physical measurements and laboratory analyses results the levels of systolic blood pressure total serum cholesterol and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol decreased among both genders from 1992 to 1997 but the difference between the survey years was statistically significant only among women both selfreported alcohol consumption and serum gammaglutamyl transferase levels increased significantly in both men and women there was a significant shift in the type of fat used on bread and in cooking from butter use to use of margarine and vegetable oil among both genders conclusions as a whole the risk factor levels in the republic of karelia are high however some slight improvement in risk profile was seen positive changes in dietary habits such as change in the quality of fat and associated reduction in serum cholesterol levels may have contributed to the decline in cardiovascular disease mortality seen in russia since 1995 however since smoking and elevated blood pressure levels as well as alcohol consumption are still highly prevalent there is a great need for effective interventions
scope mechanisms by which trans fatty acids tfa from industrial itfa and ruminant rtfa sources alter cholesterol homeostasis are virtually unknown we compared the impact of dietary itfa and rtfa on surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption betasitosterol and campesterol and synthesis lathosterol in healthy men methods and results in a randomized controlled doubleblind crossover study 38 healthy men consumed three experimental isoenergetic diets for 4wk each the three diets were i high in itfa 102 g2500 kcal ii high in rtfa 102 g2500 kcal and iii control diet low in tfa from any source 22 g2500 kcal the sum of plasma betasitosterol and campesterol concentrations was significantly reduced after the itfa diet compared with the control diet 12 p0050 the reduction in combined bsitosterol and campesterol levels was larger in magnitude after the rtfa diet 29 versus the control diet and 20 versus the itfa diet p00001 the tfarich diets had no impact on plasma lathosterol concentrations conclusions very high intakes of rtfa and itfa decrease cholesterol absorption but have no impact on cholesterol synthesis consumption of rtfa reduces cholesterol absorption to a greater extent than itfa but this difference does not ultimately affect plasma cholesterol concentrations
background whereas the negative effect of consuming trans fatty acids found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils on cardiovascular disease cvd risk is well established the effect of trans fatty acids from ruminant sources rtfas on cvd risk factors has not yet been established particularly among women objective we investigated the effects of a butter naturally enriched in rtfas of which vaccenic acid is the predominant isomer on plasma lipid concentrations among healthy women design in a doubleblind randomized crossover controlled study 61 healthy women aged 1970 y were fed 2 isoenergetic diets lasting 4 wk each the 2 diets were defined as moderately high in rtfas 37 gd 15 of daily energy and control 09 gd 03 of daily energy results no significant effect of the rtfa diet was found on total plasma cholesterol ldl cholesterol apolipoprotein b apolipoprotein ai and triglyceride concentrations compared with the control diet there was a small yet statistically significant reduction in plasma hdlcholesterol concentrations with the rtfa diet 28 p  0004 which was significant p for the bmi x treatment interaction  0006 among women with a bmi in kgm2  25 52 p  0004 n  18 but not among women with a bmi 25 12 p  013 n  43 conclusions these results suggest that an increase in dietary rtfas equivalent to similar to 1 of daily energy has no significant effect on ldl but may be associated with a reduction in plasma hdlcholesterol concentrations particularly in overweight women this trial is registered at clinicaltrialsgov as nct00930137 am j clin nutr 20129531825
background and aims the use of phytosterolenriched margarines pem in patients at cardiovascular risk has not been thoroughly explored we determined the proportion of users of pem in a population at high cardiovascular risk and their characteristics in addition the correlates of using at least 25 gd of pem were identified methods and results patients with at least two cardiovascular risk factors in addition to dyslipidemia primary prevention or with past cardiovascular disease secondary prevention were recruited by general practitioners gps baseline characteristics were collected from a computerized gp database linked to a survey gps recorded patterns of pem use first users were compared with nonusers then analyses were conducted to identify characteristics of patients using pem at a recommended dose  25 gd among 1631 patients with documented consumption a minority used pem 152 and only 364 of consumers used it at recommended level overall pem users did not differ from nonusers as to general characteristics nor as to the level of cardiovascular risk in primary prevention however pem users reported significantly more cardiovascular events among their parents or  14 95 ci  1019 consumers who used at least 25 gd of pem were more likely to be men or  31 95 ci  1658 to be aged 6074 or30 95 ci  1464 or 75 or older or40 95 cl  15106 again no difference was observed regarding the level of cardiovascular risk conclusions the level of use of pem was low in this population of high cardiovascular risk patients in addition only a third of users consumed margarine at the recommended level our data suggest that pattern of use of pem is not related to the level of cardiovascular risk c 2006 elsevier bv all rights reserved

the aim was to evaluate and compare diet and dietary habits and levels of cardiovascular risk factors in lapp and finnish reindeer herders dietary data were obtained by postal inquiry and by 24hour recall body weight height and blood pressure were measured and blood tests taken during a visit to the local health centre subjects were 668 male reindeer herders in finnish lapland 56 of whom were lapps 497 finnish and 115 whose ethnic group remained unknown the mean age of the subjects was 43 years a high daily intake of total fat 42 e saturated fatty acids 24 e and dietary cholesterol 601 mg and a low intake of carbohydrates and fibre were observed relative to dietary recommendations one third of the herders were overweight bmi over 27 kgm2 serum total cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were elevated in the majority of the subjects and 37  of them were current smokers the lapps consumed more reindeer meat 194 gday vs 65 gday p0001 more margarine 14 g vs 7 g p005 and less milk products 618 g vs 929 g p0001 than the finns due to different food patterns intakes of total fat saturated fatty acids calcium and riboflavin were lower in the lapps but intakes of protein potassium and iron were higher the lapps were 3 cm shorter than the finns but body weight and bmi were similar serum lipids and diastolic blood pressure were similar in both groups but systolic blood pressure was lower in the lapps 134 mmhg vs 139 mmhg p005 it is concluded that the diet of reindeer herders is high in fat especially saturated fatty acids and thus atherogenic although the lapps consumed considerably more reindeer meal and margarine and less milk products than the finns only slight differences were found the lipid pattern
laitinen k and h gylling 2012 dosedependent ldlcholesterol lowering effect by plant stanol ester consumption clinical evidence lipids in health and disease 11
elevated serum lipids are linked to cardiovascular diseases calling for effective therapeutic means to reduce particularly ldlcholesterol ldlc levels plant stanols reduce levels of ldlc by partly blocking cholesterol absorption accordingly the consumption of foods with added plant stanols typically esterified with vegetable oil fatty acids in commercial food products are recommended for lowering serum cholesterol levels a daily intake of 15 to 24 g of plant stanols has been scientifically evaluated to lower ldlc by 7 to 10 in different populations ages and with different diseases based on earlier studies a general understanding is that no further reduction may be achieved in intakes in excess of approximately 25 gday recent studies however suggest that plant stanols show a continuous doseresponse effect in serum ldlc lowering this review discusses the evidence for a doseeffect relationship between plant stanol ester consumption and reduction of ldlc concentrations with daily intakes of plant stanols of 4 gday or more we identified five such studies and the overall data demonstrate a linear doseeffect relationship with the most pertinent ldlcholesterol lowering outcome 18 achieved by a daily intake of 9 to 10 g of plant stanols along with reduction in ldlc the studies demonstrated a decrease in cholesterol absorption markers the serum plant sterol to cholesterol ratios by increasing the dose of plant stanol intake none of the studies with daily intakes up to 10 g of plant stanols reported adverse clinical or biochemical effects from plant stanols in a like manner the magnitude of decrease in serum antioxidant vitamins was not related to the dose of plant stanols consumed and the differences between plant stanol ester consumers and controls were minor and insignificant or nonexisting consumption of plant stanols in high doses is feasible as a range of food products are commercially available for consumption including spreads and yoghurt type drinks in conclusion a doseeffect relationship of plant stanols in higher doses than currently recommended has been demonstrated by recent clinical studies and a metaanalysis further studies are called for to provide confirmatory evidence amenable for new health claim applications and dietary recommendations
the differences between higher and lower socioeconomic groups in food consumption energy intake and nutrient density of the diet of finnish 9 to 15yearold children were examined in a study performed within the project entitled cardiovascular risk in young finns data on food consumption were collected using the 48hour recall method familys socioeconomic status was defined according to the fathers educational level his occupation and family income children of families with higher socioeconomic status used more fruit lowfat milk soft vegetable margarine and less highfat milk butter rye products and coffee than did the children of families with lower socioeconomic status consequently the main differences appeared in the fat vitamin d vitamin c and fatty acid content of the diet differences in energy intake and in mineral density of the diet were minor if these childhood dietary differences remain in adulthood it is possible that the present disparity between socioeconomic groups in mortality from coronary heart disease will not disappear
this study examines the fatty acid composition of margarines of major consumption in spain in 2000 all the margarines contained at least 20 of linoleic acid the average content of this fatty acid being 38 saturated fatty acids lauric and miristic acids did not exceed 4 of the total fatty acid content most of the margarines analyzed contained less than 5 trans c 18 1 although this content varied greatly among margarines coefficient of variation 112 being median value 25 polyunsaturated trans c182 and trans c183 did not represent more than 1 nutritionally important ratios like saturatedunsaturated fatty acids thrombogenicity and atherogenicity indexes were lower than 05 the findings suggest that spanish margarines have moved to becoming products with a potentially healthier distribution of fatty acids even so the great variability shown in fatty acid composition of margarines and poor labeling highlight the importance of greater consumer information to avoid upsetting the traditional mediterranean diet of spain
background because of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia diabetic persons have higher cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol absorption rates than do nondiabetic persons differences in plant sterol efficacy between diabetic and nondiabetic persons have not been examined objective the objective was to compare the degree of response of plasma lipid concentrations and glycemic control to plant sterol consumption in a controlled diet between hypercholesterolemic type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects design fifteen nondiabetic subjects and 14 diabetic subjects participated in a doubleblinded randomized crossover placebocontrolled feeding trial the diet included 18 gd of either plant sterols or cornstarch placebo over 21 d separated by a 28d washout period results plant sterol consumption significantly reduced p  005 ldlcholesterol concentrations from baseline in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects by 151 and 268 respectively the diabetic subjects had significantly p  005 lower absolute concentrations of total cholesterol after treatment than did the nondiabetic subjects however there was no significant difference in the percentage change from the beginning to the end of the trial there was also a significant decrease p  005 in absolute nonhdlcholesterol concentrations after treatment in both groups conclusions the results showed that plant sterols are efficacious in lowering ldl cholesterol and nonhdl cholesterol in both diabetic and nondiabetic persons plant sterol consumption may exist as a dietary management strategy for hypercholesterolemia in persons with type 2 diabetes

in considering any food or drug that lowers serum lipid levels the question arises as to the expected reduction in heart disease mortality given the reduction in serum total or lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol such quantitative assessment of the relationship between heart disease and its risk factors is best done by analysing observational and trial data in tandem since the two are complementary in strengths and weaknesses estimates based on trials alone are imprecise and short term observational data from cohort studies show that in absolute units the effect of a given cholesterol difference on heart disease risk is similar whether based on ldl or total serum cholesterol levels the relationship between heart mortality ton a logarithmic scale and serum cholesterol tin absolute units fits a linear model extremely well indicating that a constant absolute decrease in cholesterol from any point on the distribution in western countries is associated with a constant proportionate decrease in heart disease mortality the strength of the relationship varies with age being proportionately stronger in younger age groups in the age group 5564 years trial data show little reduction in heart disease risk in the first 2 years but a reduction from the third year onwards that is remarkably close to the cohort study estimate of 27 for a 06 mmol11 cholesterol reduction this result is important showing that risk is reversed relatively quickly after 2 years and reinforcing the cohort study estimate of the size of the longterm effect therefore a population dietary intervention that lowered serum cholesterol by 06 mmol 11 10 would reduce heart disease mortality after 2 years by about a quarter margarines containing plant sterolstanol esters have been shown to reduce cholesterol by about this much such an effect is particularly important in britain where the population average serum cholesterol level has not changed significantly over many years although it might be considered preferable to direct dietary intervention to those with the highest cholesterol levels in a community the large number of persons with cholesterol levels close to the average gives rise to many more heart disease deaths than the smaller number with relatively high levels and reinforces the importance of a populationwide intervention

phytosterols are natural plant compounds phytostanols are derived from phytosterols hydrogenation both they inhibit intestinal dietary cholesterol absorption by competition and they decrease ldl cholesterol by 815 in a dosedependant manner they impair carotenoids bioavailability a very small and variable part of phytosterols and phytostanols is absorbed no epidemiological data is available for assessing the beneficial of plant sterols intake and cardiovascular risk in the other hand there are many studies which have shown paradoxically a positive relationship between serum phytosterols concentrations and increase of the coronary heart disease risk other studies have established a link between the phytosterols absorption and their plasma and arterial plaque levels phytosterols and cholesterol hyperabsorbers subjects would be particularly involved in this unfavourable issue phytostanols could have a different effect from that point of view in animal studies data are less inconsistent with in most of the studies a lesser progression of atheroma lesions perhaps due to an antiinflammatory effect of phytosterols in atheroma plaque the place of phytosterols and phytostanols in the therapeutic step for cardiovascular prevention is actually not defined many queries are still open complementary studies are needed for improving the clinical indications and the efficiency of these compounds c 2007 elsevier masson sas tous droits reserves
objective the diet is the first step in managing hypercholesterolemia the objective of the present study is to assess whether moderate changes in dietary fatty acids improve plasma lipid parameters in mildly hypercholesterolemic outpatients methods using a randomized doubleblind study 121 outpatients within two groups received an isocaloric amount of unsaturated margarine or butter clinical and anthropometric measurements and a 3day food record were made chisquare and fishers tests were used to compare qualitative variables and the general linear procedure was used to compare the groups additional analyses were performed after adjustment results there was a significant difference p  003 in lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol levels between the groups total cholesterol lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol nonhighdensity lipoproteincholesterol and apolipoprotein b values decreased in the unsaturated group in comparison with the saturated group lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol changes were correlated with the variation in polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and with plasma phospholipid linoleic acid levels conclusion a small change in saturated by polyunsaturated fatty acid intake may improve plasma lipid parameters in mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects
ledoux m and l laloux 2006 conjugated linoleic acids occurrence in food and physiological properties sciences des aliments 264 291314
conjugated linoleic acids cla refer to a group of linoleic acid 182 9c 12c isomers in which the double bonds are conjugated produced during the rumination cla are naturally found in dairy products that the main cla is the rumenic acid 182 9c 11t  85 total cla cla are also produced during catalytic hydrogenation and during heating process but in that cases cla contents are low and isomer distribution drastically different during chemical synthesis the 182 10t 12c isomer is one of the main cla isomers while it is almost absent from milk fat cla intake depends on food consumption especially on dairy product intake the average intake in french population is about 018021 g clad cla are incorporated in body fat and metabolized differently according to the isomers during experimental studies on animals cla shown physiological properties potentially interesting on fat masslean mass repartition on cancer development on immune response on some components of the metabolic syndrome and on some markers of atherosclerosis risks on the opposite 182 10t 12c isomer is responsible of hepatic steatosis recently studies were done to transpose these findings on human when some would envisage to increase cla intakes via ruminant feeding or using food complements it seems interesting to review knowledge on cla
experimental and epidemiological studies have recently pointed out the influence of trans fatty acids on plasmatic cholesterol levels these studies have tried to demonstrate the incidence of the occurrence of such isomers in food on coronary heart diseases conjugated linoleic acid cla would exhibit a protective effect against chemioinducted cancers the main food sources of trans fatty acids are milk fat products partially hydrogenated oils and heated oils in this review the geometrical and positional isomer contents and distribution in milk fat products are compared to the trans fatty acid contents in margarines and partially hydrogenated vegetable fat and in cooking oils trans fatty acids in milk fat products have their origin in the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by rumen microorganisms the effect of the diet of mammals on the trans fatty acid production in milk is preponderant the biohydrogenation results mainly in 181 trans isomers especially the iitrans vaccenic acid and produces also noticeable amounts of 9cis 11trans 182 rumenic acid a conjugated linoleic acid cla having anticarcinogenic properties trans isomers in margarine are mainly 181 acids as well but the positional isomer distribution is gaussian centred around 9trans 181 elaidic acid fatty acid isomerisation during heating treatments affects linoleic 182 and alpha linolenic 183 acids two essential fatty acids all these topics are discussed in this review
n3 and trans fatty acids are considered to be the important modifiable factors of the metabolic syndrome the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that lower omega3 fatty acids andor higher trans fatty acids of erythrocytes rbc are associated with the risk of the metabolic syndrome fortyfour patients with the metabolic syndrome defined by three or more risk factors of the modified adult treatment panel iii criteria and eightyeight age and sexmatched controls with less than three risk factors were recruited for the study the mean age was 545 sem 08 years and 45  of subjects were female trans fatty acids of rbc were higher in patients than controls 082 sem 004 v 073 sem 003  p0043 while their omega3 indexes the sum of epa and dha in rbc did not significantly differ 1178 sem 004 v 1239 sem 002  multivariableadjusted regression analysis showed positive association between trans fatty acid and risk of the metabolic syndrome or 713 95  ci 153 3327 p0013 fasting serum insulin 79 sem 07 v 49 sem 03 mu uml p  0001 and high sensitivity creactive protein 18 sem 3 v 11 sem 17 mg l p0042 were also higher in patients than controls there were significant positive relationships between trans fatty acids and waist circumference and between trans fatty acids and bmi the results suggested that rbc trans fatty acids might be a predictor of increased risk for the metabolic syndrome but n3 fatty acids were not in this population
since a high intake of trans fatty acids tfa has been associated with the increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease food regulation worldwide has been amended with respect to nutrition labeling and health claims on tfa in the present study the tfa levels of korean food products were investigated to assess the regulation effect of tfa labeling same korean food products within 7 different categories were purchased in years 2005 and 2008 and the contents of tfa and lipid and fatty acid composition were investigated lipid and tfa contents decreased in all food products manufactured in 2008 tfa levels were 001 to 688 g100 g food in 2005 but the levels remarkably decreased to nondetectable level or up to 05 g tfa100 g food in 2008 the foods from 2005 contained a various level of tfa ranging 06 to 446 of total fatty acids however the tfa level significantly decreased in most foods up to 38 from year 2008 for tfas trans c181 levels were greater than trans isomers of c182 and the levels in 2005 were significantly reduced in 2008 p  005 tfa levels at the sn2 position were up to 483 of total fatty acids in 2005 but the level considerably decreased up to 54 in 2008 the considerably decreased content of tfa in 2008 suggested that food manufacturers recognized the adverse effect of tfa on human health and followed the compulsory trans fat labeling rule by korean food and drug administration kfda which started december 2007
interesterified plastic fats were produced with transfree substrates of fully hydrogenated soybean oil extra virgin olive oil and palm stearin in a weight ratio of 102070 104050 and 105040 respectively by lipase catalysis the major fatty acids of the products were palmitic 322474 stearic 120124 and oleic acid 336495 after storage at 5 degrees c refrigerator temperature or 24 degrees c room temperature for 16 h the physical properties were evaluated for solid fat content texture melting and crystallization behavior viscoelastic properties crystal polymorphism and crystal microstructure the interesterified fats contained desirable crystal polymorphs beta form as determined by xray diffraction spectroscopy they exhibited a wide plastic range of solid fat content of 5258 at 10 degrees c and 15 at 40 degrees c the physical properties were influenced by the ratio of palm stearin and olive oil harder and more brittle texture crystallization and melting at higher temperature higher solid fat contents and more elastic g or viscous g characteristics were observed in the produced fats containing a higher content of palm stearin and lower content of olive oil the produced fats stored at 5 degrees c consisted mostly of beta form crystal together with a small content of beta form while those at 24 degrees c had only beta form the produced fat with a higher amount of palm stearin appeared to have more beta form crystal and small size crystal clusters thus the physical properties of the produced plastic fats may be desirable for use in a bakery product
background phytosterolenriched margarines are known to significantly lower total and ldl cholesterol but little is known about the effect of such margarines in subjects with type 2 diabetes aim of the study investigation of the effect of a phytosterolenriched spread in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus on serum lipids hba1c and blood glucose under freeliving conditions methods randomized placebocontrolled doubleblind clinical trial in two parallel groups over 12 weeks 85 type 2 diabetic patients with serum ldl cholesterol levels greater than or equal to 360 mmoll and without hypolipidemic medication were included in the study participants consumed 2 x 10 g of spread with or without 8  phytosterolesters daily fasting blood samples were analyzed at 0 4 8 and 12 weeks results after 4 weeks total and ldl cholesterol were significantly reduced in the phytosterol group by 52  and 68  respectively compared to baseline p  005 after 8 and 12 weeks these reductions became smaller and were not significant any more compared to baseline or between the groups but a repeated measurement analysis demonstrated a significant difference for both variables between the two groups each p  005 hdl cholesterol was significantly increased in the phytosterol group compared to the placebo group after 8 and 12 weeks but there was no overall difference in the repeated measurement analysis between the two groups in the phytosterol group there was a small reduction in hba1c compared to the control group which was only significant after 4 weeks conclusions this clinical study shows that a phytosterolenriched spread is effective in lowering total and ldl cholesterol in subjects with type 2 diabetes but also illustrates the difficult maintenance under freeliving conditions over time although this effect is modest it may contribute to decreasing the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes
the varied functional requirements satisfied by trans fatty acid tfacontaining oils constrains the selection of alternative fats and oils for use as potential replacements in specific food applications we aimed to model the effects of replacing tfacontaining partially hydrogenated soybean oil phsbo with applicationappropriate alternatives on population fatty acid intakes plasma lipids and cardiovascular disease cvd risk using the national health and nutrition examination survey 24hour dietary recalls for 19992002 we selected 25 food categories accounting for 86  of soybean oil sbo and 79  of tfa intake for replacement modeling before modeling those in the middle quintile had a mean phsbo tfa intake of 12  of energy phsbo replacement in applications requiring thermal stability by either lowlinolenic acid sbo or midoleic lowlinolenic acid sbo decreased tfa intake by 03  of energy and predicted cvd risk by 0708  phsbo replacement in applications requiring functional properties with palmbased oils reduced tfa intake by 08  of energy increased palmitic acid intake by 10  of energy and reduced predicted cvd risk by 04  whereas replacement with fully hydrogenated interesterified sbo reduced tfa intake by 07  of energy increased stearic acid intake by 10  of energy and decreased predicted cvd risk by 12  phsbo replacement in both thermal and functional applications reduced tfa intake by 10  of energy and predicted cvd risk by 15  based solely on changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins all phsbo replacement models reduced estimated cvd risk albeit less than previously reported using simpler replacement models
background  intake of trans fatty acids is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease whether different classes of trans fatty acids show similar associations is unclear we previously reported an association of sudden cardiac death with red cell membrane trans182 but not trans181 fatty acids to extend these findings we investigated the associations of plasma phospholipid trans fatty acids with fatal ischemic heart disease ihd and sudden cardiac death methods and results  we conducted a casecontrol study nested in the cardiovascular health study we identified 214 cases of fatal ihd  fatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death between 1992 and 1998 we randomly selected 214 controls matched to cases on demographics prevalent cardiovascular disease and timing of blood draw plasma phospholipid fatty acids were assessed in blood samples collected earlier higher levels of plasma phospholipid trans182 fatty acids were associated with higher risk of fatal ihd odds ratio or for interquintile range 168 95 confidence interval ci 121 to 233 after adjustment for risk factors and trans181 levels trans181 levels above the 20th percentile were associated with lower risk or 034 95 ci 018 to 063 in analyses limited to cases of sudden cardiac death n95 higher levels of trans182 fatty acids were associated with higher risk or 234 95 ci 127 to 431 and higher trans181 with lower risk or 018 95 ci 006 to 054 conclusions  higher levels of trans182 and lower levels of trans181 fatty acids are associated with higher risks of fatal ihd and sudden cardiac death if confirmed these findings suggest that current efforts at decreasing trans fatty acid intake in foods should take into consideration the trans182 content
past studies of the association of transfatty acid intake with coronary heart disease have been hindered by the lack of a database on the transfatty acid content of various foods the authors used new data from the us department of agriculture to estimate transfatty acid intake using a selfadministered food frequency questionnaire ffq and they assessed the validity of the ffq by comparing the dietary estimates with transfatty acid concentrations in adipose tissue the 1996 study included 27 women and 24 men aged 5178 years the mean consumption of total transfatty acids estimated from the ffq was 224 g per day and 5 of total dietary fat the mean concentration of total transfatty acids in buttock adipose tissue was 47 of total fatty acids pearson correlations between total dietary intake of transfatty acids and total transfatty acid levels in adipose tissue were 067 95 confidence interval ci 036084 among men and 058 95 ci 026079 among women after adjustment for energy intake age and body mass index the correlation coefficients were 076 95 cl 051089 among men and 052 95 ci 017075 among women the ffq validated in this study is an important new tool for assessing usual intake of transfatty acids

high concentrations of plasma total cholesterol tc and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc accelerate atherogenesis in the teenage years and 22yearold men with high cholesterol levels are 56 times more likely to develop coronary artery disease cad 60 times more likely to have a heart attack and 96 times more likely to die during the next 40 years than those with lower cholesterol levels although the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel recommends measuring blood cholesterol levels in all adults beginning at 20 years of age the approach to be used to lower the cholesterol levels is still not clear there is controversy about using hypocholesterolemic drugs as a means of primary prevention of atherosclerosis in young adults and the american heart association aha therapeutic lifestyle changes tlc diets have limited effectiveness in many individuals with hypercholesterolemia phytosterols are in the forefront of nutraceutical research on the development of food products experimental data clearly demonstrate that phytosterols in vegetarianbased diets and in fortified foods with phytosterols are highly effective at lowering plasma cholesterol in diverse populations including children young adults and older adults the use of phytochemicals such as phytosterols to alter the food supply appears to be one of the most promising avenues to significantly prevent and mitigate the prevalence and incidence of cad in young adults
background vegetarians have lower platelet and plasma concentrations of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas than do omnivores we recently showed that male vegetarians have higher platelet aggregability than do omnivores objective we investigated whether male vegetarians n  17 who consumed an increased amount of dietary alphalinolenic acid ala showed any changes in their tissue profile of pufas plasma thromboxane concentrations platelet aggregability or hemostatic factors design during the study all subjects maintained their habitual vegetarian diets except that a proportion of dietary fat was replaced with vegetable oils and margarines that were provided initially all subjects consumed a lowala diet containing safflower oil and safflower oilbased margarine for 14 d they then consumed either a moderateala diet containing canola oil and canola oilbased margarine or a highala diet containing linseed oil and linseed oilbased margarine for 28 d blood samples were collected at day 0 baseline day 14 and day 42 results eicosapentaenoic acid docosapentaenoic acid total n3 pufas and the ratio of n3 to n6 pufas were significantly increased p  005 whereas the ratio of arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid was decreased p  005 in platelet phospholipids plasma phospholipids and triacylglycerols after either the moderateala or highala diet compared with the lowala diet no significant differences were observed in thrombotic risk factors conclusion ala from vegetable oils canola and linseed has a beneficial effect on n3 pufa concentrations of platelet phospholipids and plasma lipids in vegetarian males
the cholesterollowering effects of plant sterols in a format suitable for use in china have not previously been investigated we conducted the study to quantify in adult chinese the effects on blood lipid concentrations of a plant sterolenriched milk tea powder the study was a doubleblind randomised trial in which 309 participants were randomised to receive daily 23 or 15 g plant sterol supplementation or placebo for 5 weeks the milk tea was consumed with the two fattiest meals of the day with half the assigned daily dose taken on each occasion fasting venous blood samples were collected before commencement and upon completion of randomised treatment the mean age of study participants was 44 years 62  were female and 62  had a history of hypercholesterolaemia baseline mean total cholesterol was 55 mmoll and ldlcholesterol was 32 mmoll compared with placebo the 23 gd plant sterol dose reduced total cholesterol by 025 95  cl 007 043 mmoll p001 and the 15 gd dose by 023 95  cl 006 041 mmoll p001 for ldlcholesterol the corresponding reductions were 017 95  cl 000 035 mmola p 006 and 015 95  cl  002 032 mmoll p 008 for neither outcome was there evidence of differences between the effects of the two doses both p values 04 in conclusion the consumption of plant sterolenriched milk tea decreased cholesterol concentrations although to a lesser extent than was anticipated the reason for reduced efficacy is unclear but may be attributable to the novel food format used or the chinese population studied
we synthesized eight tanshinone anhydrides and the alcoholytic derivatives through a mild oxygeninsertion under pdc catalytic hydrogenation conditions the suppressive effects of the anhydrides on the oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein oxldl uptake and the oxldlinduced macrophagederived foam cell formation were studied our results revealed that both anhydrides la and 2a could significantly suppress the oxldl uptake in macrophages and the foam cell formation at micromolar level which might be partially attributed to their inhibition of oxldlinduced lox1 expression in macrophages
trans fatty acids tfa have been considered as an independent risk factor of coronary heart disease sudden death and insulinresistance and different tfa isomers may have different effects on the progression of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of two major tfa elaidic acid and linolelaidic acid which have the same number of carbons but a different number and configuration of trans bonds on the proliferation of human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells huvsmc methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and flow cytometry assays showed that the cell proliferation rose to 11537  a 039 and 1175  a 057  and the cell number in the s phase of the cell cycle reached 277  a 07 and 258  a 28  when treated with 50 mu m elaidic acid and 20 mu m linolelaidic acid respectively quantitative realtime reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and western blotting analyses showed that the two tfa increased the mrna and protein expression levels of pcna cdk2 and cyclin e in huvsmc moreover gas chromatography analysis showed that the total pufa level of huvsmc was lower after treatment with the two tfa especially n3 pufa these results suggested that linolelaidic acid exhibited a stronger proliferative effect on huvsmc than elaidic acid and regulation of cdk2 and cyclin e may be important for the effect of the tfa on atherosclerosis

diets high in trans fatty acids andor hydrogenated fat have been reported to increase total and low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels and in some cases decrease high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels more recent evidence supports these observations the lack of consistency among the data regarding hdl cholesterol levels may be related to differences in the actual level of trans fatty acids consumed or the relative decrease in saturated fat accompanying the dietary modification the decrease in hdl cholesterol levels when present has been related to increased cholesterol ester transferase protein cetp activity trans fatty acids have been reported to either increase or have no significant effect on lipoprotein a lpa levels whereas saturated fat has been reported to decrease lpa levels available data on the effect of trans fatty acid intake on cholesterol metabolism other than cetp activity are too limited to draw firm conclusions at this time the effect of trans fatty acids on the susceptibility of ldl to oxidation or on a variety of hemostatic factors suggest no adverse effects on this basis of the data available it appears prudent to recommend restricting both saturated and trans fatty acid intake to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease caution needs to be exerted when communicating this message so as to avoid putting undue emphasis on trans fatty acids at the expense of saturated fatty acids instead patients should be encouraged to reduce intakes of both c elsevier science inc 1998

recent studies continue to confirm previous observations that trans fatty acids elevate low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and at relatively high intakes decrease high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels considerable interest is focused on the potential benefits of transfree margarines both adipose and plasma trans fatty acid levels reflect dietary intake current estimates of trans fatty acid intake in developed countries range from 05 to 26 of energy contributed to primarily by differences in food availability and preference and partly by the methodological differences used to calculate the data curr opin lipidol 113742 c 2000 lippincott williams  wilkins
the effects on plasma lipoproteins and apolipoproteins of replacing corn oil with cornoil margarine in stick form as two thirds of the fat in the national cholesterol education program ncep step 2 diet were assessed in 14 middleaged and elderly women and men age range 4478 years with moderate hypercholesterolemia low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc range 133219 mgdl 345567 mmoll at screening during each 32day study phase subjects received all their food and drink from a metabolic kitchen subjects were first studied while being fed a diet approximating the composition of the current us diet baseline which contained 35 of calories as fat 13 saturated fatty acids sfas 12 monounsaturated fatty acids mufas 08 181n9 trans and 8 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas and 128 mg cholesterol1000 kcal this baseline phase was followed by a corn oilenriched diet containing 30 fat 6 sfa 11 mufa 04 181n9 trans and 10 pufa and 83 mg cholesterol1000 kcal and then a cornoil margarineenriched diet containing 30 fat 8 sfa 12 mufa 42 181n9 trans and 8 pufa and 77 mg cholesterol1000 kcal all diets were isocaloric mean fasting ldlc and apolipoprotein apo b levels were 153 mgdl 396 mmoll and 101 mgdl on the baseline diet 17 and 20 lower both p0001 on the corn oilenriched diet and 10 and 10 lower both p001 on the margarineenriched diet mean fasting high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc and apoai levels were 48 mgdl 124 mmoll and 134 mgdl on the baseline diet 9 and 04 lower on the corn oilenriched diet p001 for hdlc and 10 and 3 lower on the margarineenriched diet p001 for hdlc no significant effects of diet on triglyceride apoai or lipoproteina concentrations were noted replacing corn oil with a typical cornoil margarine in stick form as is currently available resulted in a 10fold increase in dietary trans fatty acid intake as well as 21 and 14 increases in sfa and mufa intake respectively and a 12 decrease in pufa intake these changes resulted in higher plasma concentrations of total cholesterol p0039 ldlc p0058 and ldl apob p0068 and a less favorable total cholesterol to hdlc ratio p0037 both experimental diets resulted in significant reductions in plasma cholesterol relative to the baseline diet however the differences resulting from the substitution of the cornoil margarine for corn oil were associated with a less favorable lipid profile with regard to coronary heart disease risk we therefore recommend that hydrogenation be minimized during the processing of foods for use in cholesterollowering diets
background metabolic studies suggest that fatty acids containing at least one double bond in the trans configuration which are found in hydrogenated fat have a detrimental effect on serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels as compared with unsaturated fatty acids containing double bonds only in the cis configuration we compared the effects of diets with a broad range of trans fatty acids on serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels methods eighteen women and 18 men consumed each of six diets in random order for 35day periods the foods were identical in each diet and each diet provided 30 percent of calories as fat with two thirds of the fat contributed as soybean oil 05 g of trans fatty acid per 100 g of fat semiliquid margarine 05 g per 100 g soft margarine 74 g per 100 g shortening 99 g per 100 g or stick margarine 201 g per 100 g the effects of those diets on serum lipoprotein cholesterol triglyceride and apolipoprotein levels were compared with those of a diet enriched with butter which has a high content of saturated fat results the mean sd serum lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol level was 17732 mg per deciliter 458085 mmol per liter and the mean highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol level was 4510 mg per deciliter 12026 mmol per liter after subjects consumed the butterenriched diet the ldl cholesterol level was reduced on average by 12 percent 11 percent 9 percent 7 percent and 5 percent respectively after subjects consumed the diets enriched with soybean oil semiliquid margarine soft margarine shortening and stick margarine the hdl cholesterol level was reduced by 3 percent 4 percent 4 percent 4 percent and 6 percent respectively ratios of total cholesterol to hdl cholesterol were lowest after the consumption of the soybeanoil diet and semiliquidmargarine diet and highest after the stickmargarine diet conclusions our findings indicate that the consumption of products that are low in trans fatty acids and saturated fat has beneficial effects on serum lipoprotein cholesterol levels n engl j med 1999340 193340 c 1999 massachusetts medical society
considerable attention in the recent past has focused on the potential benefits or adverse effects of butter versus different types of margarines usually with respect to their relative content of polyunsaturated saturated and trans fatty acids and the impact of these on lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels recently a new class of margarines and other fatderived products eg salad dressings mayonnaise containing plantderived sterols that are intended for use to lower blood cholesterol levels have been introduced into the food supply these products are being marketed as adjuncts to lowsaturatedfat and lowcholesterol diets to maximize reductions in ldl cholesterol levels achievable by dietary means

structured emulsions are widely used in the food industry in the case of waterinoil emulsions an oil phase structuration is achieved by the creation of a saturated fat crystalline network inside which water droplets are entrapped traditional technology based on the hydrogenation of vegetable oils leads to the formation of saturated transfatty acids considered unhealthy owing to their potential contribution to cardiovascular diseases as a consequence nowadays the use of hydrogenated fatty acids has been reduced and the consumption of healthy oils has increased however oils need to be properly structured to be used as solid fat replacers the present work deals with the theological study of wo emulsions structured through the oil phase crystallisation by organogelator agents mono and diglycerides of fatty acids the oil phase was prepared by blending a higholeicacidcontaining oil olive oil with a natural saturated fatty acids source cocoa butter a highly structured network is obtained by rapidly cooling the molten oil phase at low shear rates the emulsions prepared were compared with commercial margarines and they showed theological properties suitable to a potential application as solid fats c 2011 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

purpose the efficacy and safety of phytosterols for the management of dyslipidemia are reviewed summary phytosterols have been evaluated in over 40 clinical trials the incorporation of 2 g of phytosterols daily into margarine mayonnaise orange juice olive oil lowfat milk yogurt and tablets is associated with significant reductions in lowdensitylipoprotein ldl cholesterol from baseline over 112 months in adults with normal or high cholesterol in children and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus phytosterol dosages of 163 g daily have been shown to reduce ldl cholesterol by 4115 versus placebo within the first month of therapy one metaanalysis found mean reductions of 1011 but results vary several placebocontrolled trials found that the addition of phytosterols to statin therapy was associated with reductions of 720 in ldl cholesterol for up to 15 years overall phytosterols are useful for reducing ldl cholesterol in patients who cannot reach their treatment goal by diet alone or who are taking maximum tolerated doses of statins these products offer an alternative to statins in patients who cannot take statins or whose statin dosage is restricted because of potential drug interactions or concomitant diseases commonly reported adverse effects are primarily gastrointestinal in nature conclusion phytosterol therapy produces an average 1011 reduction in ldl cholesterol concentration but it is unknown whether this effect persists beyond two years phytosterol products are well tolerated and have few drug interactions but their longterm safety has not been established current evidence is sufficient to recommend phytosterols for lowering ldl cholesterol in adults
objective only a few consistent findings on individual foods or nutrients that influence breast cancer risk have emerged thus far since people do not consume individual foods but certain combinations of them the analysis of dietary patterns may offer an additional aspect for assessing associations between diet and diseases such as breast cancer it is also important to examine whether the relationships between dietary patterns and breast cancer risk are consistent across populations methods we examined the risk of breast cancer with two dietary patterns identified as vegetables veg and pork processed meat potatoes ppp common to all cohorts of the dietscan project during 7 to 13 years of followup three of the cohorts  the netherlands cohort study on diet and cancer nlcs the swedish mammography cohort smc and the ormoni e dieta nella eziologia dei tumori italyordet  provided data on 3271 breast cancer cases with complete information on their baseline diet measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire results after adjustment for potential confounders veg was not associated with the risk of breast cancer across all cohorts ppp was also not associated with the risk of breast cancer in smc and ordet but a high ppp score tended to be inversely associated with breast cancer in the nlcs study rr  069 95 ci 052092 highest versus lowest quartile ppp differed in one aspect between the cohorts butter loaded positively on the pattern in all cohorts except nlcs in which butter loaded negatively and appeared to be substituted by lowfat margarine loading positively conclusion in general the dietary patterns showed consistent results across the three cohorts except for the possible protective effect of ppp in the nlcs cohort which could be explained by a difference in that pattern for nlcs the results supported the suggestion derived from traditional epidemiology that relatively recent diet may not have an important role in the etiology of breast cancer
background results of many studies indicate that consumption of n3 fatty acids can benefit persons with cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis however encapsulated fish oil is unlikely to be suited to lifetime daily use and recommendations to increase fish intake have not been effective objective the objective was to examine the effectiveness of a diet that incorporates foods rich in n3 fatty acids in elevating tissue concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and in suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators design healthy male volunteers were provided with foods that were enriched in alphalinolenic acid cooking oil margarine salad dressing and mayonnaise and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids sausages and savory dip and with foods naturally rich in n3 fatty acids such as flaxseed meal and fish subjects incorporated these products into their food at home for 4 wk fatty acid intakes cellular and plasma fatty acid concentrations and monocytederived eicosanoid and cytokine production were measured results analyses of dietary records indicated that intake of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid averaged 18 gd and intake of alphalinolenic acid averaged 90 gd these intakes led to an average 3fold increase in eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma platelet and mononuclear cell phospholipids thromboxane b2 prostaglandin e2 and interleukin 1 beta synthesis decreased by 36 26 and 20 p  005 respectively conclusions foods that are strategically or naturally enriched in n3 fatty acids can be used to achieve desired biochemical effects without the ingestion of supplements or a change in dietary habits a wide range of n3enriched foods could be developed to support largescale programs on the basis of the therapeutic and diseasepreventive effects of n3 fatty acids

martin j c and k valeille 2002 conjugated linoleic acids all the same or to everyone its own function reproduction nutrition development 426 525536
conjugated linoleic acid cla is a generic term referring to a mixture of geometrical and positional isomers of linoleic acid in which up to 16 members have been identified many potentially beneficial health effects have been ascribed to these fatty acids when consumed as a mixture and where generally 2 isomers dominate e g the 9c11tisomer the socalled rumenic acid and the 10t12cisomer anticarcinogenic immune modulator antiatherosclerotic and antiobesity among the most spectacular the question arises as to whether the pleiotropic biological activity is supported by one or several of the isomers recent studies using pure individual isomers have started to elucidate this issue but many others are required to ascribe a respective role to each cla isomer the main ones as well as the minor ones such as those occurring in some complex mixtures already commercially available or even in foodstuff the aim of the present study was to focus on the claisomer specific effects depicted in the literature up to now
to assess the validity of two techniques used to measure human cholesterol synthesis the rate of uptake of deuterium d into plasma free cholesterol fc and plasma cholesterol precursor squalene lanosterol desmosterol and lathosterol levels were compared in 14 women 6571 yr with low density lipoproteincholesterol ldlc greater than or equal to 336 mmoll1 subjects consumed each of six diets for 5wk periods according to a randomized crossover design the experimental diets included a baseline diet 39 energy as fat 164 mg chol42 mj1 and five reducedfat diets 30 of energy as fat where twothirds of the fat was either soybean oil squeeze tub or stick margarines or butter fractional and absolute synthesis rates fsr and asr of fc were determined using the deuterium incorporation di method while cholesterol precursor levels were measured using gasliquid chromatography data were pooled across diets for each variable and correlation coefficients were calculated to determine if associations were present there was good agreement among levels of the various cholesterol precursors in addition fsr in poolsd pd1 and asr in gramsd gd1 were strongly associated with lathosterol r  072 and 071 p  00001 desmosterol r  075 and 075 p  00001 lanosterol r  067 and 067 and squalene r  069 and 068 when levels of the precursors were expressed as mu molmmol1 c significant but lower correlations were observed between the d uptake and plasma cholesterol precursor levels when the latter were expressed in absolute amounts mu moll1 the wide range of fatty acid profiles of the experimental diets did not influence the degree of association between methods in conclusion the di method and levels of some cholesterol precursors correspond as methods for shortterm measurement of cholesterol synthesis
the objectives of the present study are to describe the dietary sources of total fat and of saturated fatty acids sfa and to formulate foodbased dietary guidelines for sfa in belgian adolescents a random sample of 1318yearold adolescents was drawn from secondary schools in the region of ghent a 7 d estimated food record method was used to quantify nutrient and food intake the average daily sfa intake is 4 above the recommended 10 of the total energy contribution the most important contributors of sfa on food group level were fats oils and savoury sauces meat and meat products sugar confectionery sweet fillings and sauces cheese milk and milk products and bread rusk and breakfast rolls on food subgroup level fresh meat highfat margarine and highfat cheese had the highest contribution to sfa intake in all adolescents adolescents with a low sfa intake lowest tertile were compared with adolescents with a high intake highest tertile in the lowest tertile the intake of total fat and mufa was significantly lower than in the highest tertile while the intake of total carbohydrates mono and disaccharides and complex carbohydrates was significantly higher overall the highfat cheese intake is significantly lower in the lowest tertile while the fruit intake is higher the present analysis shows that the nutritional profile of belgian adolescents could be potentially improved by decreasing the portion sizes of fresh meat in boys highfat margarine highfat cheese and reducing intake of commercially prepared baked goods and processed foods including fast foods
background consumption of phytosterolsupplemented margarine lowers total plasma cholesterol tc and ldlcholesterol concentrations in older middleaged hypercholesterolemic individuals the effects of incorporating phytosterols into lowerfat foods on the plasma lipids of young men at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease have not been studied objective we tested the hypothesis that a single daily dose of soybean phytosterols added to ground beef will lower plasma tc and ldlcholesterol concentrations in mildly hypercholesterolemic young men design in a tripleblind 4wk study 34 male college students with elevated plasma tc 585  070 mmoll ldl cholesterol 402  060 mmoll and tchdl cholesterol 55  12 were randomly assigned to the control ground beef alone or treatment ground beef with 27 g of phytosterols group the phytosterol mixture was twothirds esterified and onethird nonesterified and consisted of betasitosterol 48 campesterol 27 and stigmasterol 21 results consumption of phytosterolsupplemented ground beef lowered plasma tc and ldlcholesterol concentrations and tchdl cholesterol from baseline by 93 146 and 91 respectively p  0001 the ldl particle size did not change suggesting that the decrease was primarily of particle number the decreases were similar in subjects with n  8 and without n  9 a family history of premature cardiovascular disease no significant changes were found in the control group conclusion phytosterolsupplemented ground beef effectively lowers plasma tc and ldl cholesterol and has the potential to become a functional food to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease

health authorities around the world advise limiting consumption of trans fatty acids however in australia the trans fatty acid tfa content is not required to be listed in the nutrition information panel unless a declaration or nutrient claim is made about fatty acids or cholesterol since there is limited knowledge about trans fatty acid levels in processed foods available in australia this study aimed to determine the levels of tfa in selected food items known to be sources of tfa from previously published studies food items n92 that contain vegetable oil and a total fat content greater than 5 were included this criterion was used in conjunction with a review of similar studies where food items were found to contain high levels of trans fatty acids lipids were extracted using solvents gravimetric methods were used to determine total fat content and trans fatty acid levels were quantified by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy high levels of trans fatty acids were found in certain items in the australian food supply with a high degree of variability of the samples analysed 13 contained greater than i g of trans fatty acids per serving size the highest value was 81 gserving apart from when the nutrition information panel states that the content is less than a designated low level food labels sold in australia do not indicate trans fatty acid levels we suggested that health authorities seek ways to assist consumers to limit their intakes of trans fatty acids

intestinal fat absorption is known to be overall a highly efficient process but much less is known about the efficiency with which individual dietary fatty acids fa are absorbed by the adult small intestine we therefore measured the absorption efficiency of the major dietary fa using sucrose polybehenate spb as a nonabsorbable marker and analyzed how it is modulated by acyl chain physicochemical properties and polymorphisms of proteins involved in chylomicron assembly dietary fa absorption efficiency was measured in 44 healthy subjects fed a standard diet containing 35 fat and 5 spb fa and behenic acid ba were measured in homogenized diets and stool samples by gas chromatographymass spectroscopy and coefficients of absorption for each fa were calculated as 1  fabafecesfabadiet absorption coefficients for saturated fa decreased with increasing chain length and hydrophobicity mean  se and ranged from 095  002 for myristate 140 080  003 for stearate 18 0 to 026  002 for arachidate 200 absorption coefficients for unsaturated fa increased with increasing desaturation from 079  003 for elaidic acid 18 1t 096  001 for linoleate 182 to near complete absorption for eicosapentaenoic 205 and docosahexaenoic 226 acids of several common genetic polymorphisms in key proteins involved in the chylomicron assembly pathway only the intestinal fatty acidbinding protein2 a54t allele rs1799883 had any impact on fa absorption we conclude that acyl chain length saturation and hydrophobicity are the major determinants of the efficiency with which dietary fa are absorbed by the adult small intestine

objectives in 60 healthy humans a blend of commonly used edible vegetable fats was compared with the same fat blend after random chemical interesterification for their effects in terms of nutritional safety on blood lipids blood enzymes and hemostasis parameters design both fat blends were supplied doubleblind at two energy levels 4 and 8 of energy in margarine according to a parallel design at either energy level the two fat blends were consumed according to a crossover design for two periods of three weeks without an intermediate washout period results the 30 parameters studied revealed no statistically significant differences between the two fat blends except for slightly similar to 10 lower ddimers concentrations after consumption of the interesterified fat blend conclusions increased levels of the fibrindegradation products ddimers are positively associated with risk for coronary heart disease thus it was concluded that the inclusion of a chemically interesterified vegetable fat blend in the diet of healthy people does not influence fasting blood lipids blood enzymes andor hemostasis parameters in an adverse way when compared with a noninteresterified fat blend with the same fatty acid composition
transfatty acids tfas can be produced either from biohydrogenation in the rumen of ruminants or by industrial hydrogenation while most of tfas effects from ruminants are poorly established there is increasing evidence that high content of industrial tfas may cause deleterious effects on human health and life span indeed several epidemiological and experimental studies strongly suggest that high content of most tfa isomers could represent a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases by a mechanism that lowers the good hdl cholesterol and raises the bad ldl cholesterol with respect to the general precautionary principle and considering the existence of an international policy consensus regarding the need for public health action some industrialized countries such as france are still not sufficiently involved in preventive strategies that aim to efficiently reduce tfas content and tfas consumption and produce alternative healthier fat sources in this manuscript we provide an overview about tfas origins their use and consumption among french population we also discuss their potential human health implications as well as the preventive and regulatory measures undertaken in france
trans fatty acids tfas mainly arise from 2 major sources natural ruminal hydrogenation and industrial partial catalytic hydrogenation increasing evidence suggests that most tfas and their isomers cause harmful health effects that is increased risk of cardiovascular diseases nevertheless in spite of the existence of an international policy consensus regarding the need for public health action several countries for example france do not adopt sufficient voluntary approaches for example governmental regulations and systematic consumer rejections nor sufficient industrial strategies for example development of healthier manufacturing practices and innovative processes such as fat interesterifications to eliminate deleterious tfas from processed foods while ensuring the overall quality of the final product for example nutritional value and stability in this manuscript we first review the physicalchemical properties of tfas their occurrence in processed foods their main effects on health and the routine analytical methods to characterize tfas before emphasizing on the major industrial methods that is fat food reformulation fat interesterification genetically modified fas composition that can be used worldwide to reduce tfas in foods
current scientific evidence indicates that consumption of industrial trans fatty acids tfa produced via partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils increases the risk of coronary heart disease however some studies have suggested that ruminant tfa especially vaccenic acid va or 11t181 and rumenic acid ra or 9c11t1 82 which is a conjugated linoleic acid cla isomer may have potential beneficial health effects for humans to date no concerted effort has been made to provide detailed isomer composition of ruminant tfa and cla of canadian dairy products information that is required to properly assess their nutritional impacts to this end we analyzed the fatty acid profile of popular brands of commercial cheese n  17 butter n  12 milk n  8 and cream n  4 sold in retail stores in ottawa canada in 20062007 by silver nitrate thinlayer chromatography and gas liquid chromatography the average total tfa content of cheese butter milk and cream samples were 56 58 58 and 55 of total fatty acids respectively va was the major transoctadecenoic acid 181 isomer in all the canadian dairy samples with average levels of as  total trans181 339 in cheese 356 in butter 310 milk and 301 in cream the different dairy products contained very similar levels of cla which ranged from 05 to 09 of total fat ra was the major cla isomer of all the dairy products accounting for 824832 of total cla there were no significant differences p  005 in the fatty acid profile between the 4 different dairy groups which suggests lack of processing effects on the fatty acid profile of dairy fat
in the seven countries study associations between the intake of foodgroups and 25year mortality from coronary heart disease chd defined as sudden coronary death or fatal myocardial infarction were investigated baseline surveys were carried out between 1958 and 1964 a number of individual characteristics were measured in 12763 middleaged men belonging to 16 cohorts in seven countries usa finland the netherlands italy former yugoslavia greece and japan dietary information was collected in subsamples using the weighed record method vital status of all participants was verified at regular intervals during 25 years of followup and the underlying cause of death was adjudicated eighteen different foodgroups and combinations were considered for comparison among cohorts large differences in foodgroup consumption were seen with high consumption of dairy products in northern europe meat in the usa vegetables legumes fish and wine in southern europe and cereals soy products and fish in japan population death rates from chd showed large differences ranging from 268 per 1000 in east finland to 25 per 1000 in crete greece animal foodgroups were directly correlated and vegetable foodgroups except potatoes as well as fish and alcohol were inversely correlated with chd mortality univariate analysis showed significant positive correlation coefficients for butter r  0887 meat r  0645 pastries r  0752 and milk r  0600 consumption and significant negative correlation coefficients for legumes r  0822 oils r  0571 and alcohol r  0609 consumption combined vegetable foods excluding alcohol were inversely correlated r  0519 whereas combined animal foods excluding fish were directly correlated r  0798 with chd death rates multivariate stepwise analysis selected butter lardmargarine and meat as significant predictors and produced an r2 of 0922 these findings were confirmed by factor analysis these crosscultural analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that dietary patterns are important determinants of differences in population chd death rates and confirm the opposite effects on apparent risk of animal and vegetable foods

serum lipoproteina lpa is a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease we therefore examined the effect of dietary fatty acid composition on serum lpa levels in three strictly controlled experiments with healthy normocholesterolemic men and women in expt i 58 subjects consumed a control diet high in saturated fatty acids for 17 days for the next 36 days 65 of total energy intake from saturated fatty acids was replaced by monounsaturates plus polyunsaturates monounsaturated fatty acid diet n  29 or by polyunsaturates alone polyunsaturated fatty acid diet n  29 both diets caused a slight nonsignificant increase in median lpa levels with no difference between diets in expt ii 10 of energy from the cholesterolraising saturated fatty acids lauric myristic and palmitic acid was replaced by oleic acid or by transmonounsaturated fatty acids each of the 59 participants received each diet for 3 weeks in random order the median level of lpa was 26 mgl on the saturated fatty acid diet it increased to 32 mgl p  0020 on the oleic acid diet and to 45 mgl p  0001 on the transfatty acid diet the difference in lpa between the transfatty acid and the oleic acid diets was also highly significant p  0001 expt iii involved 56 subjects all received 8 of energy from stearic acid from linoleic acid or from transmonounsaturates for 3 weeks each all other nutrients were equal median lpa levels were 69 mgl on both the stearate diet and linoleate diet and rose to 85 mgl p  001 on the trans diet changes in lpa were positively related to initial levels samples from expt i had been stored for 3 months those from expt ii for 31 months and samples from expt iii for 14 months at 40degreesc or lower comparison of 19 paired samples suggested that storage may have caused an overall decrease of 512 in lpa levels with no effect on the order of ranking of lpa within studies these shortterm experiments suggest that diets high in transmonounsaturated fatty acids may increase serum levels of lpa
trans fatty acids are produced during industrial hydrogenation of vegetable and marine oils hydrogenation is used to change the characteristics of oils so that they can be incorporated into food items such as margarines shortenings salad oils and highfat baked goods hydrogenated oils however are not the only source of trans fatty acids in the human diet fat from ruminants also contains small amounts of trans fatty acids due to natural biohydrogenation by bacteria in the rumen most trans fatty acids have 18 carbon atoms and one double bond transc181 information on the average intake of trans fatty acids as well as on the variation in intake between individuals is scarce because of missing and unreliable figures for transc181 in most food composition tables the health aspects of transc181 have been evaluated and the general conclusion was that intakes of transc181 had no adverse effects on health five years ago however interest in transc181 revived because it was reported that transc18l raised lowdensity lipoproteins and lpa and lowered highdensity lipoproteins as compared with oleic acid cisc181 the results from all of the recent studies combined suggest that effects of transc181 on lowdensity lipoproteins and highdensity lipoproteinswhich may be mediated by cholesterol ester transfer proteinare dosedependent with no threshold effect this suggests that the intake of transc181 like that of the cholesterolraising saturated fatty acids should be as low as possible to minimize coronary heart disease risk

recognising that the health benefits of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa are attributable to the long chain lc pufa eicosapentanoic acid 205n3 docosapentanoic acid 225n3 and docosahexanoic acid 226n3 we have sought to define tbe health potential of foods containing the short chain precursor n3 pufa alphalinolenic acid 183n3 by assuming that a limited proportion of their 183n3 content say 15 will be converted to 205n3 225n3 or 226n3 we derived an lc n3 pufa equivalent value for such foods using data from australian food composition tables recent publications and personal communications from food companies and relevant researchers the total fat content total n6 fatty acids 183n3 205n3 225n3 226n3 total n3 fatty acids and estimated lc n3 pufa equivalent value are presented for nuts and seeds butters margarines dairy blends and spreads fats and oils salad dressings milk and dairy products cheeses eggs meats fresh dish and canned fish fish is the richest source of lc n3 pufa but other foods have the potential to make important contributions to the requirement for lc n3 pufa while the hypothesised conversion rate from 183n3 to lc n3 pufa is only a crude estimate and probably an overestimate we believe it is more meaningful to make this adjustment when formulating dietary recommendations than not to differentiate between foods rich in either 183n3 or 205n3226n3 and erroneously assume that they offer the same health benefits in this sense the lc n3 pufa equivalent is a better indicator of the potential health benefit of the n3 fatty acid contents of foods

a clear relationship has been documented between plasma levels of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc and the risk of coronary heart disease ldlc is believed to be key in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis although increasing evidence suggests that low levels of highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels are contributory factors chylomicron remnants formed via the exogenous dietary and biliary pathway of cholesterol metabolism may also have atherogenic potential dietary modification especially with plant stanol sterol ester margarine which inhibits cholesterol absorption and improves the fatty acid pattern lowers ldlc sufficiently in many hypercholesterolaemic patients and is also a useful adjunct to pharmacological therapy cholesterol absorption inhibitors typically lower ldlc by 1020 ezetimibe the first selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor has been shown to lower ldlc by approximately 18 following a oncedaily 10 mg dose either as monotherapy or as combination therapy combination therapy with selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as ezetimibe along with statins or fibrates may allow more patients with hypercholesterolaemia to achieve target ldlc levels compared with treatment with monotherapy ezetimibe may be useful in the management of patients who respond poorly to or are unable to tolerate statins or in patients with hereditary or druginduced phytosterolaemia

renewal has occurred in the use of plant sterols for the treatment of hypercholesterolemias a novel development was to convert plant sterols to corresponding stanols and esterify them to fat soluble form in contrast to the crystalline plant sterols or stanols plant stanol esters can be easily consumed during normal food intake in soluble form in different fatcontaining food constituents when they have a potent cholesterollowering effect shown in normo and hypercholesterolemic men and women without or with coronary heart disease children and diabetes cholesterol lowering is approximately 10 for total and 15 for ldl cholesterol with the respective values for stanol ester margarine 23 gday stanols being 15 and 20 stanol esters reduce cholesterol absorption efficiency by up to 65 increase cholesterol elimination in feces as cholesterol itself usually not as bile acids and stimulate cholesterol synthesis serum betacarotene level is lowered but no fat malabsorption or lowering of serum fat soluble vitamins have been observed in contrast to plant sterols stanols and their esters are minimally absorbed and they reduce serum plant sterol concentrations also preventing statininduced increase of plant sterols stanol ester margarine has been included in dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia followed by the addition of drug treatment in resistant cases curr opin lipidol 10914 c 1999 lippincott williams  wilkins

normal human diet contains small amounts of phytosterols mainly sitosterol and campesterol intestinal absorption of these plant sterols is low about one tenth of that of cholesterol such that their serum concentrations are also low about 01 to 1 of the cholesterol levels like cholesterol they are transported by lipoproteins mainly by ldl and secreted unchanged in bile addition of plant sterols or especially of their delta5 saturated derivatives plant stanols into diet as fatsoluble esters inhibit cholesterol absorption and lower serum cholesterol similarly in shortterm studies longterm consumption of plant stanol esters lowers serum cholesterol to the extent expected to reduce clinical manifestation of coronary heart disease by over 20 without detectable side effecs cholesterol lowering being especially effective in combination with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors statins

statin trials have indicated that effective reduction of serum cholesterol should last up to one year before reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases can be detected this observation can be applied most probably also to the use of plant stanolsterol ester spreads for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia however despite the fact that the two spreads lower serum cholesterol similarly in short term studies a comparison of one year results reveals an inconsistent effect of plant sterol spread as compared with that of plant stanol spread on cholesterol concentration in both men and women this favors the use of plant stanol ester spread for longterm lowering of serum cholesterol doses of about 2 gday of plant stanols as fatty acid ester spread enhances fecal elimination of cholesterol but not of bile acids through inhibition of cholesterol absorption by about 40 this lowers serum total and low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol despite enhanced compensatory increase in cholesterol synthesis by about 10 and 15 as compared with control spread respectively and by up to 20 as compared with the baseline diet about onethird of mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects reach an accepted cholesterol level a small dose of statin should be added to treatment in individuals resistant to monotherapy with plant stanol ester spread a lifelong consumption of plant stanol ester spread has been predicted to lower coronary events by about 20

normal serum contains small amounts of noncholesterol sterols including those reflecting cholesterol absorption and those that are markers of cholesterol synthesis absorption marker sterols include serum plant sterols whereas cholesterol precursor sterols correlate with wholebody synthesis of cholesterol thus serum noncholesterol sterols and especially their ratios to cholesterol can be used to evaluate the major features of cholesterol metabolism ie synthesis and absorption statin treatment reduces serum cholesterol precursors but increases serum plant sterols severalfold especially in subjects with highabsorption marker sterol levels indicative of efficient cholesterol and sterol absorption in general statin therapy is most effective in subjects with high serum cholesterol precursor levels in subjects with highabsorption sterol markers dietary cholesterol absorption inhibition eg with plant stanol and sterol ester margarine needs to be combined with a statin to achieve effective serum cholesterol reduction however whereas dietary plant stanol esters reduce statininduced elevations of serum plant sterol levels serum plant sterol levels remain elevated during dietary plant sterol ester consumption the clinical implication of high serum plant sterol levels is under active investigation c 2005 elsevier inc all rights reserved

miettinen t a and h gylling 2009 the effects of statins and sitosterols benefit or not current atherosclerosis reports 111 2327
statins reduce plasma plant sterol concentrations and less consistently their ratios to cholesterol in shortterm studies they most likely accomplish this by decreasing their transport protein levels in longterm treatment with large doses of effective statins serum plant sterol concentrations and frequently their ratios to cholesterol are consistently increased especially with high as opposed to low baseline ratios enhanced intestinal absorption decreased biliary secretion and reversed cholesterol and plant sterol transport could explain these findings however statin treatment increases plant sterol ratios in serum and also in arterial plaques of endarterectomized patients no trials of functional foods with plant sterols or stanols are available for coronary heart disease even though their combination with statins effectively reduces lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol plant sterols increase and plant stanols decrease serum plant sterols longterm statin treatment lowers coronary heart disease events only in patients with low baseline plant sterols who have high cholesterol synthesis no convincing evidence is available that statininduced phytosterolemia worsens atherosclerosis
coronary patients with low baseline ratios of serum cholestanol and plant sterols to cholesterol indicating low cholesterol absorption but not those with high ratios high absorption experienced reduced recurrences of coronary events during simvastatin treatment in the scandinavian simvastatin survival study thus in the present study serum cholesterol its precursor sterols reflecting cholesterol synthesis plant sterols campesterol and sitosterol and cholestanol were measured before and during a 5year period of placebo treatment n433 and simvastatin treatment n434 in patients from a subgroup of the scandinavian simvastatin survival study to determine whether changes in cholesterol synthesis and serum levels were related to cholesterol absorption serum cholesterol level was unchanged the ratios of cholesterol precursor sterols to cholesterol were decreased and the ratios of plant sterols to cholesterol were increased in relation to increasing baseline ratios of cholestanol qualtiles the latter predicted 5year ratios and simvastatininduced reductions of the precursor sterols with the lowering of the ratios cholesterol synthesis reduction being almost twice higher in the lowest versus the highest quartile the ratios of plant sterols especially campesterol to cholesterol were markedly increased during simvastatin treatment mostly in subjects with the highest baseline cholestanol quartiles simvastatin reduced serum cholesterol mon p0003 in the lowest versus the highest cholestanol quartile during the 5year treatment period the results show for the first time that baseline cholesterol metabolism measured by serum noncholesterol sterols predicts the effectiveness of simvastatin in reducing cholesterol synthesis and serum levels of cholesterol the drug suppresses the synthesis of cholesterol markedly more effectively in subjects with high than with low baseline synthesis but reduces respective serum cholesterol levels less markedly than synthesis subjects with high cholesterol absorption and low synthesis may need a combination therapy to lower more effectively their serum cholesterol levels and prevent an increase in the levels of plant sterols

this study was conducted to determine the secretion rate and composition of lipoproteins secreted by hepg2 cells as influenced by the type of fatty acid present in the incubation medium cells were preincubated for 24 h with palmitic oleic elaidic linoleic or conjugated linoleic acid cla and the lipoproteins secreted during a subsequent incubation period of 24 h were collected for analysis the secretion rate of apolipoprotein b100 apob was significantly greater in hepg2 cells preincubated with elaidic acid compared with those preincubated with palmitic or oleic acid apob secretion was greater in cells preincubated with cla compared with those preincubated with linoleic acid the lipid composition of secreted lipoproteins was also influenced by fatty acid treatment resulting in significantly smaller lipoprotein particles secreted by cells preincubated with elaidic acid and cla compared with those secreted by cells treated with oleic acid and linoleic acid respectively our results are relevant to human metabolism for the following reasons 1 the size of plasma lowdensity lipoproteins ldls is determined at least in part by the composition of apobcontaining lipoproteins secreted by the liver 2 small plasma ldl particles are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and 3 specific dietary fatty acids can affect the composition and size of plasma ldls thereby imparting a relative atherogenicity to plasma ldls independent of ldl cholesterol concentration the present study therefore suggests that elaidic acid and cla promote the hepatic secretion of small apobcontaining lipoproteins which could lead to an increased production of small plasma ldl particles c 2005 elsevier inc all rights reserved

although plant sterols phytosterols and cholesterol have similar chemical structures they differ markedly in their synthesis intestinal absorption and metabolic fate phytosterols inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption thereby lowering plasma total and lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels in 16 recently published human studies that used phytosterols to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in a total of 590 subjects phytosterol therapy was accompanied by an average 10 reduction in total cholesterol and 13 reduction in ldl cholesterol levels phycosterols may also affect other aspects of cholesterol metabolism that contribute to their antiatherogenic properties and may interfere with steroid hormone synthesis the clinical and biochemical features of hereditary sitosterolemia as well as its treatment are reviewed and the effects of cholestyramine treatment in 12 sitosterolemic subjects are summarized finally new ideas for future research into the role of phytosterols in health and disease are discussed am j med 1999107588594 c 1999 by excerpta medica inc
poloxamer 188 is a complex polydisperse mixture of nonionic macromolecules adverse nonigemediated hypersensitivity reactions occur in some individuals following intravenous injection of poloxamer 188based pharmaceuticals presumably via complement activation here we have delineated potential causal chemical and biological interactive factors behind poloxamer 188induced complement activation in human serum specimens we identified the molecular constituents inherent in poloxamer 188 preparations and studied their effect on generation of the two complement split products sc5b9 and bb poloxamer 188 activated complement at submicellar concentrations and the results indicated the potential involvement of all three known complement activation pathways the poloxamerinduced rise of sc5b9 in human sera was abolished in the presence of a recombinant truncated soluble form of complement receptor type 1 thus confirming the role of c3c5 convertases in the activation process poloxamer 188mediated complement activation is an intrinsic property of these macromolecules and was independent of the degree of sample polydispersity as opposed to other nonpolymeric constituents poloxamer 188 preparations also contained unsaturated chains of diblock copolymers capable of generating sc5b9 in human sera this effect was terminated following the removal of double bonds by catalytic hydrogenation by quasielastic light scattering we established interaction between poloxamer and lipoproteins interestingly poloxamerinduced rise in sc5b9 was significantly suppressed when serum hdl and ldl cholesterol levels were increased above normal to mimic two relevant clinical situations this observation was consistent with previously reported data from patients with abnormal or elevated lipid profiles where no or poor complement activation by poloxamer 188 occurred our findings could provide the basis of novel approaches to the prevention of poloxamermediated complement activation c 2004 elsevier bv all rights reserved

applying a combination of argentation thinlayer chromatography astlc and gas chromatography contents of transhexadecenoic acids transc161 have been determined in 27 german bovine milkfats and 62 german partially hydrogenated edible fats it could be demonstrated that due to an overlap with c17 fatty acids frequently too high transc161 contents have been measured particularly for milkfats if no preseparation by agtlc was applied according to the present studies milkfats contain 013  and partially hydrogenated margarines and cooking fatsshortenings of vegetable origin 004  resp 001  transc161 on average in contrast products containing partially hydrogenated fish oil n  6 exhibited relatively high transc161 contents of 189  on average moreover besides the widespread transoctadecenoic acids transc181 these products additionally contain high amounts of transelcosaenoic acids transc201 of 449  on average the presented results could be of use for future considerations concerning theories of an association of transc161 contents in human lipids with the incidence of coronary heart diseases
the present study compares the atherogenicity of a standard diet and diets with 10 olive oil or 10 margarine added in rabbits maintained at a mean plasma cholesterol level of about 20 mm for 13 weeks each group consisted of 15 animals the distribution of cholesterol in plasma between vldl idl ldl and hdl was similar in the 3 groups the thoracic aortic cholesterol accumulation was 166  16 114  10 p  005 and 126  17 p  005 nmolmg wet weight for the group receiving standard diet diet with 10 olive oil added and diet with 10 margarine added respectively there was no significant difference between groups in the occurrence of the atherosclerotic changes in the proximal and distal parts of coronary arteries abdominal aorta and renal arteries the occurrence of atherosclerotic changes in the pulmonary arteries was equal in the groups receiving standard diet and diet with 10 margarine added while it was significantly lower p  005 in the group receiving diet with 10 olive oil added the atherosclerotic changes at the aortic orifice of coronary arteries were quanticated morphometrically and were most severe in the group on the standard diet the results indicate a comparable atherogenic effect of 10 olive oil or margarine addition to standard diet on development of atherosclerosis in rabbits maintained at a similar plasma cholesterol level the study also suggests that supplementation of olive oil or margarine to standard rabbit diet leads to lower cholesterol accumulation in the thoracic aorta compared with standard diet an effect not modulated by changes in plasma cholesterol concentrations

background trans fatty acid tfa intake predicts risks of coronary artery disease and diabetes systemic inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of such conditions however relations between tfa intake and systemic inflammation are not well established objective we investigated the relations between tfa intake and inflammatory markers design in 823 generally healthy women in the nurses health study i and ii concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor a receptors 1 and 2 stnfr1 stnfr2 interleukin 6 il6 and creactive protein crp were measured usual dietary intakes assessed from 2 semiquantitative foodfrequency questionnaires were averaged for each subject results in ageadjusted analyses tfa intake was positively associated with stnfr1 and stnfr2 p for trend  0001 for each stnfr1 and stnfr2 concentrations were 10  108 pgml 95 ci 50167 pgml and 12 258 pgml 138377 pgml higher respectively in the highest intake quintile than m the lowest these associations were not appreciably altered by adjustment for body mass index smoking physical activity aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use alcohol consumption and intakes of saturated fat protein n6 and n3 fatty acids fiber and total energy adjustment for serum lipid concentrations partly attenuated these associations which suggests that they may be partly mediated by effects of tfas on serum lipids tfa intake was not associated with il6 or crp concentrations overall but was positively associated with il6 and crp in women with higher body mass index p for interaction  003 for each conclusions tfa intake is positively associated with markers of systemic inflammation in women further investigation of the influences of tfas on inflammation and of implications for coronary disease diabetes and other conditions is warranted
the trans fatty acid tfa patterns in the fats of ruminant meat and dairy products differ from those found in other processed fats we have evaluated different tfa isomers in human breast milk as an indicator of dietary intake of ruminant and dairy fats of different origins breast milk samples were collected 1 month postpartum from 310 mothers participating in the koala birth cohort study the netherlands the study participants had different lifestyles and consumed different amounts of dairy products fatty acid methyl esters were determined by gcfid and the data were evaluated by principal component analysis pca anovapost hoc test and linear regression analysis the two major principal components were 1 18 1 transisomers and 2 markers of dairy fat including 15 0 17 0 11trans 18 1 and 9cis 11trans 18 2 cla despite similar total tfa values the 9trans 18 111trans 18 1ratio and the 10trans 18 111trans 18 1ratio were significantly lower in milk from mothers with high dairy fat intake 4076 gday 091  048 p  005 compared to low dairy fat intake 010 gday 159  048 and lower with strict organic meat and dairy use 90 organic 092  046 p  005 compared to conventional origin of meat and dairy 140  061 similar results were obtained for the 10trans 18111trans 18 1ratio we conclude that both ratios are indicators of different intake of tfa from ruminant and dairy origin relative to other including industrial sources
we have compared the effects on lipoproteins and haemostatic variables of two hard margarines with similar functional properties one traditional margarine containing partially hydrogenated fish oil phfo and one experimental margarine based on vegetable oil vo both were allpurpose cooking margarines with nearly identical functional properties trans fatty acids from phfo in the traditional margarine were replaced mostly by saturated monounsaturated and trans fatty acids of vegetable origin in the new formulation both test margarines contained approximately the same amount of cis polyunsaturated fatty acids sixteen female normolipidaemic students consumed each diet with the two test margarines for 14 d in random order crossover design the amount of fat was 31 energy in the phfo diet and 32 energy in the vo diet the test margarines provided approximately 26 energy in both diets in the phfo diet 78 of the energy was derived from trans fatty acids and 92 from saturated fatty acids 120 140 and 160 while in the vo diet 11 energy was derived from trans fatty acids and 133 from saturated fatty acids 120 140 and 160 the natural content of cholesterol in phfo was deliberately not balanced by addition of cholesterol to the vo diet thus the phfo diet contained 215 mg and the vo diet 86 mg cholesterol per 85 mj ldlcholesterol concentration was 19 higher in subjects on the phfo diet compared with the vo diet p001 the ratio ldlcholesterolhdlcholesterol was 126 higher in subjects on the phfo diet compared with the vo diet p  001 the level of apolipoprotein apoai was 6 lower in subjects on the phfo diet compared with the vo diet p001 the ratio apobapoai was 104 higher in subjects on the phfo diet than on the vo diet p  001 there were no significant differences in total cholesterol hdlcholesterol triacylglycerols apob lipoproteina and haemostatic variables between the diets our results demonstrate that phfo with its unfavourable effects on plasma lipids can be replaced by vegetable oils in margarine without appreciable loss of functional properties but with significant improvement in the effects on plasma lipoproteins

chemical hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids is a commonly applied reaction to food industries the process may imply the movement of double bonds in their positions on the fatty acid carbon chain producing positional and geometrical isomers trans fatty acids through hydrogenation unsaturated oils are converted to margarines and vegetable shortenings the presence of trans fatty acids in foods is undesirable as trans fatty acids raise the plasma levels of total and lowdensity lipoproteins ldl while decrease the plasma level of highdensity lipoproteins hdl among other effects the use of olive oil to prepare fat spread opens new insights into the commercial development of healthy novel foods with a positive image in terms of consumer appeal

the effects of stearic acid c180 and trans fatty acids on variables related to coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied in 80 healthy humans average age 29  9 years all subjects consumed a baseline diet high in saturated fatty acids mainly from dairy fat for 5 weeks after this baseline diet they were allocated either to a diet high 87 of energy en in trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil 40 subjects or a diet high 93 en in stearic acid 40 subjects for 5 weeks all diets contained 322339 en fat 146158 en saturated plus trans fatty acids 122125 en cismonounsaturated and 2935 en polyunsaturated fatty acids and 216250 mg10 mj cholesterol the fats were mixed into solid foods and almost all daily food was provided in comparison with the baseline dairy fat diet no change was observed in the concentrations of plasma fibrin degradation products and ddimers also the factor vii coagulant activity f viic tissue type plasminogen activity tpa and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity pai1 were not affected by the experimental diets small increase in plasma fibrinogen concentration during the stearic acid diet was statistically significant from 349 to 363 gl p  0041 but probably without any biological significance both diets increased plasma level of lipoprotein lpa it can be concluded that as far as coagulation and fibrinolysis are concerned there is no need to differentiate between stearic acid or trans monoenoic fatty acids ddimers were also associated with increased risk of future myocardial infarction although their level was not an independent predictor when the other risk factors were considered 10 some dietary factors are known to influence f viic tpa and pai1 activities the factors affecting f viic are total fat cholesterol and fibre 1113 tpa is affected by total fat 11 13 and pai1 is influenced by n3 fatty acids 14 and total fat and fibre 13 15 the effects of dietary factors on the levels of ddimers has not been studied stearic acid c180 is considered less harmful for chd risk than saturated fatty acids with 1216 carbon atoms since it does not affect serum total or ldlcholesterol 1618 furthermore when compared with fatty acids with 1216 chain length stearic acid diet has been shown to lower f viic 15 19 however an increase in fibrinogen level in healthy subjects on a high stearic acid diet 19 as well as an observation that stearic acid can provide a contact surface that activates factor vii 20 suggest that stearic acid can be less favorable in terms of chd risk than anticipated based on its effect on cholesterol metabolism to find out if there are differences in the effects of trans fatty acids and stearic acid on the variables of coagulation and fibrinolysis we carried out a dietary intervention study in a strictly controlled way so that besides stearic acid and trans fatty acids the amounts of cis monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diets were kept constant
the present study evaluates the effect of dietary trans fatty acids on diaphragm phospholipid fatty acid composition intramyocellular triacylglycerol content and insulinstimulated glucose uptake in comparison with dietary saturated fatty acids male weanling wnin rats were divided into three groups and fed for 3 months on one of the following diets containing 10  oil differing in fatty acid composition control diet saturated fatty acid diet and trans fatty acid diet dietary trans fatty acids increased the intramyocellular triacylglycerols and decreased the ratio of 20  4n6 to 18  2n6 and longchain pufa levels 20  in diaphragm phospholipids indicating inhibition of pufa biosynthesis however saturated fatty acids decreased both 18  2n6 and 20  4n6 without change in the ratio trans fatty acidinduced alterations in diaphragm phospholipid fatty acid composition and intramyocellular triacylglycerol content were associated with decreased insulinstimulated glucose transport in the diaphragm these observations suggest that dietary trans fatty acids decrease diaphragm insulin sensitivity possibly due to increased intramyocellular triacylglycerol accumulation and decreased longchain pufa in phospholipids

saturated vegetable oils coconut palm and palm kernel oil containing predominantly saturated fatty acids lauric 120 or myristic 140 and palmitic 160 raise plasma total cholesterol tc and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc levels in animals and humans presumably by decreasing ldl receptor activity andor increasing ldlc production rate although stearic acid 180 is chemically a saturated fatty acid both human and animal studies suggest it is biologically neutral neither raising nor lowering blood cholesterol levels although earlier studies indicated that medium chain fatty acids 80100 were also thought to be neutral more recent studies in animals and humans suggest otherwise unsaturated vegetable oils such as corn soybean olive and canola oil by virtue of their predominant levels of either linoleic acid 182 or oleic acid 181 are hypocholesterolemic probably as a result of their ability to upregulate ldl receptor activity andor decrease ldlc production rate whether trans fatty acids such as trans oleate t181 in hydrogenated products such as margarine are hypercholesterolemic remains controversial studies in humans suggest that their cholesterolraising potential falls between the native nonhydrogenated vegetable oil and the more saturated dairy products such as butter assessment of the magnitude of the cholesterolemic response of trans 181 is difficult because in most diet studies its addition is often at the expense of cholesterollowering unsaturated fatty acids making an independent evaluation almost impossible
hypercholesterolemia represents a significant risk for cardiovascular disease cvd while diet intervention remains the initial choice for the prevention and treatment of cvd the nature of the dietary modification remains controversial for example reducing calories from total fat without decreasing saturated fat intake results in insignificant changes in low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc similarly diet interventions that focus solely on lowering dietary cholesterol and saturated fat intake not only decrease ldlc but also high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc and therefore may not improve the lipoprotein profile this brief review summarizes dietary interventions that lower ldlc without affecting hdlc levels these interventions include soy protein soluble fiber soy lecithin and plant sterols this review also includes some of the reported dietary interventions such as polyphenols isoflavones folic acid and vitamins b6 and b12 which reduce the risk of cvd without changes in lipoprotein cholesterol
nielsen h 1992 n3 polyunsaturated fish fattyacids in a fishoilsupplemented bread journal of the science of food and agriculture 594 559562
white bread enriched in n3 fatty acids in the form of gelatinecoated fish oil and marketed in denmark since 1990 under the name of omega bread was found to be a reliable and significant source of higher n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with 20 and 22 c atoms the bread from six bakeries contained 4055 mg per 100 g more n3 fatty acids by eating 200 g daily of this bread one gets some 2530 of the amount of higher n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids present in 30 g of mixed fish the daily ingestion of this amount of fish over a period of 20 years is known to reduce mortality from coronary heart disease by more than 50 the supplement of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids obtained by eating omega bread daily in place of other types of white bread is expected to reduce coronary heart disease in addition such an increased daily ingestion of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids over a longterm period may possibly have other beneficial health effects it is recommended that the intake of higher n3 fatty acids in industrialised western societies should be increased by more than can be obtained by a daily ration of omega bread it is therefore advisable that consumption of omega bread is combined with an increased intake of fish andor fish oil capsules andor fishoilenriched substitutes for butter and margarine
trans fatty acid consumption in the human diet can cause adverse health effects such as cardiovascular disease which is associated with higher total cholesterol a higher low density lipoproteincholesterol level and a decreased high density lipoproteincholesterol level the aim of the study was to elucidate the hepatic response to the most abundant trans fatty acid in the human diet elaidic acid to help explain clinical findings on the relationship between trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease the human hepg2 cell line was used as a model to investigate the hepatic response to elaidic acid in a combined proteomic transcriptomic and lipidomic approach we found many of the proteins responsible for cholesterol synthesis upregulated together with several proteins involved in the esterification and hepatic importexport of cholesterol furthermore a profound remodeling of the cellular membrane occurred at the phospholipid level our findings contribute to the explanation on how trans fatty acids from the diet can cause modifications in plasma cholesterol levels by inducing abundance changes in several hepatic proteins and the hepatic membrane composition
phytosterols found in fatsoluble fractions of plants chemically resemble cholesterol and inhibit cholesterol absorption in the small intestine phytosterol consumption in human subjects reduces plasma total and low density lipoproteincholesterol ldlc levels the primary aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a lowfat spread enriched with plant sterols in reducing total and ldlc concentrations in primary hypercholesterolemia the secondary objective was to evaluate whether patients receiving a lipidlowering drug fibrate might differ in their response to plant sterols the study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled twoperiod crossover trial with two treatments and three periods both treatment periods lasted 2 months with a washout period 2 months between them spread enriched with plant sterols was compared to nonenriched control spread fortified fat spread provided 16 gday of plant sterols derived from edible vegetable oils and fatty acids from sunflower seed oil the plant sterol content consisted of sitosterol esters 50 campesterol esters 25 stigmasterol esters 20 and 10 of other esters data in 53 hypercholesterolemic patients 31 females and 22 males who completed the study were as follows patients were 58  12 years of age with mean body mass index 235  28 kgm2 mean  sd no adverse sideeffects of the diet were reported plasma total cholesterol and ldlc concentrations were significantly reduced by 64 and 88 respectively after using the spread enriched in plant sterols as compared to controls 00 and 13 respectively no effect on high density lipoproteincholesterol hdlc and lipoproteina concentrations was detected when subjects were divided in two subgroups according to fibrate treatment supplementation with phytosterols decreased plasma cholesterol and ldlc by 85 and 111 respectively in the subgroup of patients treated with fibrates in the group of patients who did not receive fibrates consumption of plant sterol margarine reduced plasma cholesterol and ldlc by 55 and 77 respectively spread enriched with plant sterol esters significantly lowers blood total and ldlc levels without affecting hdlc concentrations in a hypercholesterolemic population following a strict low cholesterol diet ncep step1 in addition a combination of fibrate treatment and plant sterol estersupplemented spread offers a safe and effective measure to significantly decrease abnormally high cholesterol levels we conclude that phytosterolen rich ed spread is a useful adjunctive therapy for hypercholesterolemic patients
the consumption of trans fatty acid tfa is linked to the elevation of ldl cholesterol and is considered to be a major health risk factor for coronary heart disease despite several decades of extensive research on this subject the underlying mechanism of how tfa modulates serum cholesterol levels remains elusive in this study we examined the molecular interaction of tfaderived phospholipid with cholesterol and the membrane receptor rhodopsin in model membranes rhodopsin is a prototypical member of the gprotein coupled receptor family it has a wellcharacterized structure and function and serves as a model membrane receptor in this study phospholipidcholesterol affinity was quantified by measuring cholesterol partition coefficients phospholipidreceptor interactions were probed by measuring the level of rhodopsin activation our study shows that phospholipid derived from tfa had a higher membrane cholesterol affinity than their cis analogues tfa phospholipid membranes also exhibited a higher acyl chain packing order which was indicated by the lower acyl chain packing free volume as determined by dph fluorescence and the higher transition temperature for rhodopsin thermal denaturation the level of rhodopsin activation was diminished in tfa phospholipids since membrane cholesterol level and membrane receptors are involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis the combination of higher cholesterol content and reduced receptor activation associated with the presence of tfaphospholipid could be factors contributing to the elevation of ldl cholesterol

we compared the effects on plasma lipids of margarines containing tither a trans fatty acid tfafree hard fraction achieved through interesterification from primarily saturated fatty acids or a partially hydrogenated hard fraction thirtyeight mildly hyperlipidemic subjects consumed a lowfat diet for 2 wk they were then allocated to 2 groups and underwent 3 dietary interventions for 3 wk each in random order diets contained 35 of energy as fat with 20 of energy as margarines or butter group 1 n  18 butter canola oil blend with tfas and tfafree canola oil blend group 2 n  19 butter polyunsaturated oil blend with tfas and tfafree polyunsaturated oil blend plasma ldlcholesterol concentrations after consumption of all oil blends and after the loweat diet were not significantly different but were 1115 lower than after butter p  0001 whereas the canola oil blends did not differ from each other in their effects on lipoprotein profiles the tfafree polyunsaturated oil blend resulted in a significant 6 reduction 025 mmoll 95 ci 008 042 in total and ldl cholesterol compared with the blend containing tfas p  0006 in the canola oil blend 10 tfas and 6 oleic acid were replaced by approximate to 14 saturated fatty acids plus a 2 increase in linoleic acid in the polyunsaturated oil blend 10 tfas and 5 linoleic acid were replaced by a 10 increase in saturated fatty acids as well as 3 and 1 increases in oleic and linolenic acids respectively we conclude that compared with butter tfafree margarines may be equal to or more effective than margarines containing tfas in lowering ldl cholesterol
the objective of the study was to investigate whether different initial baseline cholesterol levels modulate the efficacy of a spread enriched with plant sterolesters ps in lowering blood cholesterol in a japanese population consuming their usual diet healthy adults with a mean age of 45 y and mean plasma total cholesterol tc level of 65 mmoll were recruited to participate in a doubleblind trial comprised of a runin period of 1 wk followed by two intervention periods of 3 wks in a 2 x 2 crossover design and a posttrial followup of 3 wk volunteers consumed two spreads one enriched with ps 12 g100 g plant sterols and a control spread not fortified with ps recommended spread intake was 15 gd effects on plasma lipids lipoproteins betacarotene and vitamins a and e were assessed plasma tc and ldl cholesterol ldlc concentrations were 58 and 91 lower respectively when subjects consumed the ps spread than when they consumed the control spread p  0001 subjects were divided into two groups normal and mildly cholesterolemic tc 57 mmoll and hypercholesterolemic tc greater than or equal to 57 mmoll reductions p  0001 in tc and ldlc due to treatment in the former group were 49 and 79 respectively in the hypercholesterolemic group the reductions p  0001 were 71 and 106 respectively the decreases did not differ between normalmildly cholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic subjects plasma apolipoprotein b apob and remnantlike particle rlp cholesterol rlpc concentrations were lower when subjects consumed the ps spread 443 gl than the control spread 497 gl plasma pcarotene concentration was lower p  0001 in subjects consuming the ps spread than in the control changes in plasma vitamins a and e levels did not differ after intake of the ps and control spreads in conclusion consumption of a psenriched spread effectively lowered plasma tc ldlc apob and rlpc regardless of baseline plasma tc at an intake of 18 gd of plant sterols
dietary intake of plant sterol esters pse lowers plasma ldlcholesterol ldlc but can modestly increase plasma plant sterol concentrations the objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of increasing doses of dietary pse on plasma and liver sterol concentrations as well as on aortic foam cell development as a marker of atherogenesis onehundred and twenty fib hybrid syrian golden hamsters 20 per group were fed a basal atherogenic diet containing 30 of energy as fat and 012 ww cholesterol and supplemented with 0 024 048 096 192 and 284 ww pse after 12 weeks plasma total cholesterol tc and ldlc were significantly lower in the groups fed pse compared with control plasma plant sterol concentrations increased with increasing dietary pse intake up to the dietary level of 192 and then reached a plateau on the other hand hepatic campesterol and sitosterol concentrations plateaued at 024 pse foam cell presence in the aortic arch showed an inverse relationship with dietary pse intake p  00001 lipidfilled foam cell areas of hamsters receiving 024 048 or 284 pse were approximately 70 90 and 100 smaller than in control hamsters fed no pse in summary dietary pse lowered plasma tic and ldlc despite an increase in plasma plant sterol concentrations they did not contribute to aortic foam cell development in fact dietary pse significantly inhibited aortic foam cell formation this study supports the concept that pse through their cholesterollowering action prevent development of atherogenesis in this animal model c 2003 elsevier science ireland ltd all rights reserved
consumers are increasingly aware that food components have the potential to influence human health maintenance and disease prevention and dietary fatty acids fa have been of special interest it has been 25 years since the last survey of us milk fa composition and during this interval substantial changes in dairy rations have occurred including increased use of total mixed rations and byproduct feeds as well as the routine use of lipid and fa supplements furthermore analytical procedures have improved allowing greater detail in the routine analysis of fa especially trans fa our objective was to survey us milk fat and determine its fa composition we obtained samples of fluid milk from 56 milk processing plants across the us every 3 mo for one year to capture seasonal and geographical variations processing plants were selected based on the criteria that they represented 50 or more of the fluid milk produced in that area an overall summary of the milk fat analysis indicated that saturated fatty acids comprised 637 of total milk fa with palmitic and stearic acids representing the majority 441 and 183 of total saturated fatty acids respectively unsaturated fatty acids were 332 of total milk fa with oleic acid predominating 710 of total unsaturated fatty acids these values are comparable to those of the previous survey in 1984 considering differences in analytical techniques trans fa represented 32 of total fa with vaccenic acid being the major trans isomer 465 of total trans fa cis9 trans11 182 conjugated linoleic acid represented 055 total milk fa and the major n3 fa linolenic acid 183 composed 038 analyses for seasonal and regional effects indicated statistical differences for some fa but these were minor from an overall human nutrition perspective as the fa profile for all samples were numerically similar overall the present study provides a valuable database for current fa composition of us fluid milk and results demonstrate that the milk fatty acid profile is remarkably consistent across geographic regions and seasons from the perspective of human dietary intake of milk fat
background and aim to compare the cholesterollowering efficacy and other metabolic effects of plant sterol and stanol esters both of which are commonly used in the dietary management of hypercholesterolaemia methods and results the cholesterollowering efficacy of equivalent intakes of sterol and stanol esters and of different intakes of stanol esters were compared at 1 and 2 months both in normal subjects and treated patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia systemic effects were assessed by measuring serum levels of plant sterols and of lathosterol and 7alphahydroxycholestenone indices of sterol absorption and of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis respectively there were no significant differences during the study between 16g daily of sterol and stanol esters in reducing total cholesterol by 37 or low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 48 nor between 16 and 26 g daily of stanol however the cholesterollowering effect of plant sterol esters was attenuated between 1 and 2 months this was accompanied by increased serum plant sterols and decreased levels of 7ahydroxycholestenone especially in statintreated hypercholesterolaemic patients not taking bile acid sequestrants conclusions these findings suggest that absorption of dietary plant sterols suppressed bile acid synthesis thereby diminishing their cholesterollowering efficacy in contrast plant stanols reduced plant sterol absorption and maintained their cholesterollowering efficacy c 2004 medikal press
background dietary fat consumed during childhood and adolescence may be related to the development of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases in adulthood however there is a lack of information on specific fatty acid intakes and food sources in these populations our study aimed to assess fatty acid intakes in australian adolescents compare intakes with national guidelines and identify major food sources of fatty acids methods dietary intake was assessed using measured 3d records in 822 adolescents aged 1315 y participating in the western australian pregnancy cohort raine study australia results mean daily total fat intakes were 90  25 g for boys and 73  20 g for girls with saturated fat contributing 14 of total energy intake mean contribution to daily energy intake for linoleic alphalinolenic eicosapentaenoic docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were 30 040 002 001 and 004 respectively for boys and 33 042 002 001 and 005 for girls to meet guidelines for chronic disease prevention consumption of longchain omega3 fatty acids in this population may need to increase up to threefold and the proportion of saturated fat decrease by onethird girls were more likely to achieve the guidelines major food sources were dairy products for total fat saturated fat and alphalinolenic acid margarines for linoleic acid and fish for longchain omega3 fatty acids conclusion results suggest that for this population a higher dietary intake of longchain omega3 fatty acids particularly for boys and lower proportion of saturated fat is required to meet recommendations for prevention of chronic disease c 2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved

background evidence on the relation between trans fatty acid intake and coronary heart disease is limited we investigated this relation in a dutch population with a fairly high trans fatty acid intake including trans fatty acids from partly hydrogenated fish oils methods we prospectively studied 667 men of the zutphen elderly study aged 6484 years and free of coronary heart disease at baseline we used dietary surveys to establish the participants food consumption patterns information on risk factors and diet was obtained in 1985 1990 and 1995 after 10 years of followup from 198595 there were 98 cases of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease findings between 1985 and 1995 average trans fatty acid intake decreased from 43 to 19 of energy after adjustment for age body mass index smoking and dietary covariates trans fatty acid intake at baseline was positively associated with the 10year risk of coronary heart disease the relative risk for a difference of 2 of energy in trans fatty acid intake at baseline was 128 95 ci 101161 interpretation a high intake of trans fatty acids tall types of isomers contributes to the risk of coronary heart disease the substantial decrease in trans fatty acid intake mainly due to industrial lowering of trans contents in dutch edible fats could therefore have had a large publichealth impact

recent studies have shown that the fatty acid profile of dietary lipid has the potential for improving the health of consumers the present study was conducted to determine the fatty acid composition of commercial milks namely dairyoh homomilk dohm which is naturally enhanced with docosahexaenoic acid dha or regular homomilk hm the milk was collected from local supermarkets the most abundant saturated fatty acids in the milk were butyric c40 lauric cl 20 myristic cl 40 palmitic cl 60 and stearic cl 80 acids among unsaturated fatty acids oleic acid cis9c181 was also considerably high 5027 mg100 ml of milk the concentration of total trans181 was higher p  005 in dohm than in hm 1347 vs 1070 mg100 ml of milk respectively whereas total cis181 was higher p  005 in hm than in dohm 5664 vs 5084 mg100 ml of milk respectively the concentration of dha was 240 times higher p  005 in dohm than in hm dohm contained 28 times higher p  005 eicosapentaenoic acid epa compared to hm milk fat from dohm contained a greater concentration of cis9trans11 conjugated linoleic acid cla 164 vs 116 mg100 ml of milk dohm vs hm respectively the total omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids content was 223 times greater p  005 in dohm compared with hm due to an increase in c183n3 epa and dha the result of the milk fatty acid analyses indicates that milk fat from dohm had increased contents of epa dha and cis9trans11 cla which could have a more favorable impact on diet composition and healthfulness
consumers are aware of foods containing microcomponents that may have positive effects on health maintenance and disease prevention in ruminant milk meat and milk products these functional food components include eicosapentaenoic acid 205n3 docosahexaenoic acid 226n3 9c11tconjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid 11t181 modifying ruminal microbial metabolism of fatty acid in rumen through animal diet formulation is an effective way to enhance these functional fatty acids in ruminantderived food products however it requires an understanding of the interrelationship between supply of lipid through the diet and rumen fermentation lipids in ruminant diets undergo extensive hydrolysis and biohydrogenation in the rumen apparent transfer efficiency of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid from feed to milk is very low 19 to 33 which is to a large extent related to their extensive biohydrogenation in the rumen therefore feeding a rumenprotected supplement containing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid can be used to bypass the rumen ruminantderived foods also contain different types of conjugated linoleic acid isomers which are intermediates of rumen biohydrogenation of linoleic acid 9c12c182 the predominant isomer of conjugated linoleic acid is 9c11t which has numerous health benefits in animal models the concentration of conjugated linoleic acid in ruminantderived food products can be significantly enhanced through animal diet modification we conclude that most current functional food products from ruminants have potential for their healthsupporting properties and for this market to succeed an evidencebased approach should be developed in humans
hypercholesterolaemia is one of the main factors contributing to the appearance and progression of cvd which is the main cause of death in the adult population of industrialized societies by 2020 projections suggest that it will continue to hold first place by then causing 37  of all deaths therapeutic lifestyle changes to reduce cardiovascular risk include dietary modifications such as the inclusion of phytosterols or plant sterols known since the 1950s to reduce cholesterol levels these help prevent the absorption of cholesterol and thus condition a reduction in total cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels and ultimately in cardiovascular mortality the fatsoluble nature of these sterols rendered margarine one of the best vehicles by which to supply them in the diet indeed margarine was the first food to contain cholesterolreducing phytosterols to be approved by the eu in agreement with its regulations on new foods and food ingredients 25897ce presently phytosterols can be emulsified with lecithin and thus delivered in nonfat or lowfat foods and beverages margarine and dairy products yoghurt and milk enriched in phytosterols have proved better at lowering total cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels than have enriched cereals and their derivatives although all can be of help depending on the characteristics of each subject the reduction in carotenoid bioavailability caused by sterols is minimized by increasing fruit and vegetable consumption individuals who habitually consume phytosterols should also follow traditional advice such as eating less dietary fat and increasing their physical activity phytosterols have been shown to be safe and effective in lowering cholesterol levels in many rigorous studies in few areas of nutrition is there such consensus diet professionals should feel comfortable in prescribing phytosterolsstanols for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia they are safe whether taken alone or in combination with cholesterolreducing drugs such as statins and fibrates reinforcement counselling is essential as therapy is effective only if compliance is good

phytosterols are cholesterollike molecules found in all plant foods with the highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils they are absorbed only in trace amounts but inhibit the absorption of intestinal cholesterol including recirculating endogenous biliary cholesterol a key step in cholesterol elimination natural dietary intake varies from about 167437 mgday attempts to measure biological effects in feeding studies have been impeded by limited solubility in both water and fat esterification of phytosterols with longchain fatty acids increases fat solubility by 10fold and allows delivery of several grams daily in fatty foods such as margarine a dose of2 gday as the ester reduces low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 10 and little difference is observed between delta5sterols and 5alphareduced sterols stanols phytosterols can also be dispersed in water after emulsification with lecithin and reduce cholesterol absorption when added to nonfat foods in contrast to these supplementation studies much less is known about the effect of low phytosterol levels in the natural diet however reduction of cholesterol absorption can be measured at a dose of only 150 mg during otherwise sterolfree test meals suggesting that natural food phytosterols may be clinically important current literature suggests that phytosterols are safe when added to the diet and measured absorption and plasma levels are very small increasing the aggregate amount of phytosterols consumed in a variety of foods may be an important way of reducing population cholesterol levels and preventing coronary heart disease
trans fatty acids from hydrogenated vegetable and marine oils could be as hypercholesterolemic and atherogenic as saturated fatty acids hence it is important to know the fatty acid composition in major food contributors eg margarines and shortenings in 1992 margarines were examined and in 1995 brands covering the entire danish market were examined significant amounts of trans181 were found only in hard margarines mean 42  28 and shortenings mean 68  31 whereas the semisoft and soft margarines contained substantially less trans181 in 1995 than in 1992 where marine oils had been used to a larger degree the mean transmonoenoic content was about 15 of which close to 50 was made up of longchain c20 and c22 trans fatty acids a noteworthy decrease in the content of trans181 had occurred for the semisoft margarines from 98  61 in 1992 to 12  22 in 1995 calculated from sales figures the supply of trans181 plus saturated fatty acids from margarines has decreased over this threeyear period by 14 gday which has been replaced by cis monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids
this study examined trans monounsaturated fatty acid contents in all margarines and shortenings marketed in denmark and in frying fats used by the fastfood restaurants burger king and mcdonalds trans c181 content was 41  38 g per 100 g fatty acids in hard margarines significantly higher than the content in soft margarines of 04  08 shortenings had an even higher content of trans c181 67  23 than the hard margarines margarines and shortenings with high contents of longchain fatty acids had about 20 total trans monoenoic of which close to 50 were made up of trans longchain fatty acids both fastfood frying fats contained large amounts of trans c181 219  29 in burger king and 166  04 in mcdonalds in denmark the per capita supply of trans c181 from margarines and shortenings and frying fats has decreased steadily during recent years the supply of trans c181 from margarines and shortenings in the danish diet is now 11 g per day

parillo m and g riccardi 2004 diet composition and the risk of type 2 diabetes epidemiological and clinical evidence british journal of nutrition 921 719
in the last 10 years nutritional research on diabetes has improved dramatically in terms of both number of studies produced and quality of methodologies employed therefore it is now possible to attempt to provide the evidence on which nutritional recommendations for the 1 prevention of type 2 diabetes could be based we therefore performed a literature search and among the papers published in indexed journals we selected relevant epidemiological mostly prospective and controlled intervention studies lifestyle factors that have so far been consistently associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes are overweight and physical inactivity however recent evidence from epidemiological studies has shown that the risk of type 2 diabetes is also associated with diet composition particularly with 1 low fibre intake 2 a high trans fatty acid intake and a low unsaturated saturated fat intake ratio 3 absence of or excess alcohol consumption all these factors are extremely common in western populations and therefore the potential impact of any intervention on them is large indeed  90  of the general population has one or more of these risk factors the ability to correct these behaviours in the population is estimated to reduce the incidence of diabetes by as much as 87  recent intervention studies have shown that type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle changes aimed at bodyweight reduction increased physical activity and multiple changes in the composition of the diet within this context the average amount of weight loss needed is not large about 5  initial weight which is much less than the weight loss traditionally considered to be clinically significant for prevention of type 2 diabetes in conclusion new emphasis on prevention by multiple lifestyle modifications including moderate changes in the composition of the habitual diet might limit the dramatic increase in incidence of type 2 diabetes envisaged worldwide
the consumption of foods containing trans fatty acids tfas is a matter of concern at present according to many studies trans fatty acids tfas may cause illnesses such as the coronary heart disease diabetes mellitus large intestine cancer and breast cancer they can also raise low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and reduce high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol tfas can also inhibit the synthesis of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids in arterial cells as a consequence the food and drug administration has deemed that saturated fatty acid cholesterol and trans fatty acid levels be listed on food labels as of 2006 the korea food and drug administration also has required the listing of trans fatty acid content on food labels since 2007 the aim of this study was to determine the total lipid and trans fatty acid tfa contents in retort food powdered milk biscuit and pizza products the number of samples examined were 2 retort food 6 powdered milk 7 biscuit and 3 pizza products the extraction of total lipids in retort food and powdered milk followed the chloroformmethanol method the extraction of total lipids in biscuit and pizza was by the acid digestion method all samples were analyzed by gas chromatography gc using a sp2560 capillary column and a flame ionization detector the tfa contents per 100 g of sample were 128 19 in retort foods 0424 137 in powdered milk products 029 123 in biscuits and 28345 303 in pizzas
small amounts of trans fatty acids exist naturally in beef and dairy foods also they can be produced in the process of partial hydrogenation to manufacture shortning or margarine they can provide a better palatability and shelf life according to the recently studies trans fatty acids call raise health risk such as heart diseases and coronary artery diseases they can also increase lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and decrease highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol in the blood plasma therefore increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and diabetes the aim of this study was to determine total lipids and trans fatty acids tfas content in processed foods and meat products the analysis of trans fatty acids was performed in 28 samples of donuts 18 samples of bakeries 4 samples of frozen doughs 2 samples of popcorns and 4 samples of meat products ham sausage nuget and bacon total lipids in processed foods and meat products were extracted by chloroformmethanol method and acid digestion respectively they were analyzed by gas chromatography using a sp2560 column and flame ionization detector the amounts of tfas per 100 g of foods were 033 074 on average in donuts 0258 118 on average in bakeries 0263 193 on average in frozen doughs and 058 in popcorns meat products such as ham sausage and nuget analyzed 01 of tfas respectively and trans fatty acids in bacon were not detected as a result the distribution of tfas in processed foods was widely ranged from 0 to 63 according to manufacturers and types of products whereas the content of tfas in meat products ranged from 0 to 01

even though trans fatty acids tfas are present in natural sources such as foods from ruminant origins the development of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil contributed to a significant increase in total tfas consumption in humans currently tfa consumption is considered to be a risk factor for coronary heart diseases researchers are now starting to discover that not all tfas behave in a similar manner that is isomer specificity may be found among nonconjugated tfas plant originated tfas mainly elaidic and linolelaidic acids are particularly linked to increased risk for coronary heart diseases while animal originated tfas mainly vaccenic acid are not among conjugated tfas two major isomers of conjugated linoleic acid cla cis9trans11 and trans10cis12 show distinctive biological activities a number of clinical trials of cla with effects on body composition have been reported but effects on coronary heart disease risk factors have been inconsistent meanwhile safety concerns regarding cla in particular isomer specificity have also been raised thus it is critical to identify isomer specific effects of tfas on particular risk factors to determine their health impact c 2009 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that erythrocytes that are low in n3 fatty acids and high in transfatty acids and nutrient intakes are associated with the risk of atherosclerosis fifty patients with acute nonfatal myocardial infarction were recruited to measure their dietary intake erythrocyte fatty acid composition intima medial thickness imt and the gensini score which are markers of atherosclerosis transoleic acid of erythrocytes was positively p  05 correlated with the carotid imt after adjusting for age sex and energy intake the imt was negatively associated with the intake of protein fat phosphate zinc vitamin b1 vitamin b2 vitamin b6 niacin linoleic acid linolenic acid total fatty acids total n3 fatty acids and total n6 fatty acids the gensini score was also negatively associated with the intake of protein fat phosphate sodium zinc vitamin e vitamin b i vitamin b2 vitamin b6 niacin linolenic acid total fatty acids and total n3 fatty acids in conclusion lower levels of transoleic acid elaidic acid in erythrocytes and higher intakes of vitamins minerals and n3 fatty acids were associated with the decreased risk of atherosclerosis however these findings need further investigation in randomized controlled clinical trials before public health recommendations for atherosclerosis prevention can be made c 2009 elsevier inc all rights reserved

since conjugated linoleic acid cla was identified as a principal anticancer component from ground beef in the 1980s cla research has discovered that cla has a wide range of biologically beneficial effects clinical studies with cla are on the rise and it is apparent that cla may not be as effective in humans as in rodents in particular its antiobesity aspect in addition research with regard to other conjugated fatty acids as well as cla metabolites is still in its infancy investigation of bioactivities for other conjugated fatty acids and cla metabolites may help to extend the understanding of cla and its mechanisms of actions this may pose an opportunity to use cla more efficiently and expand the future use of other conjugated fatty acids as pharmacological agents to assist current treatments

milk fat contains a number of components of nutritional significance the first section of the review outlines the composition structure and certain biochemical and physiological characteristics of these components in recent times the nutritional image of milk fat has suffered adversely because of the association of saturated fat and cholesterol with coronary heart disease the various elements that are used to justify this lipidheart disease hypothesis are discussed and the strength of the evidence is assessed contrary evidence which is mostly overlooked in authoritative reviews is presented trans fatty acid consumption is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease however the associations generally do not apply to trans acids of animal origin these acids are mainly vaccenic and rumenic acids that may possess antiatherogenic properties other health related benefits for rumenic acid particularly its role in the prevention of mammary tumorigenesis are outlined milk fat contains other potential anticancer agents such as sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids butyric acid 13methyltetradecanoic acid ether lipids and vitamin a pasturederived compounds like betacarotene betaionone gossypol and phytol may also help prevent cancer finally the review discusses the antimicrobial action of milk fat and its role in longchain polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism bone growth ulcerogenesis and energy metabolism
the purpose of this study was to test if replacement of trans fatty acids by palmitic acid in an experimental margarine results in unfavourable effects on serum lipids and haemostatic factors we have compared the effects of three different margarines one based on palm oil palmmargarine one based on partially hydrogenated soybean oil transmargarine and one with a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufamargarine on serum lipids in 27 young women in nine of the participants fasting levels and diurnal postprandial levels of haemostatic variables on the 3 diets were compared the sum of 120 140 160 provided 11 of energy e in the palm diet the same as the sum of 120 140 160 and trans fatty acids in the transdiet oleic acid provided 1011e in all three diets while pufa provided 57 55 and 102 e respectively total fat provided 3031 and the test margarines 26 of total energy in all three diets each of the diets was consumed for 17 days in a crossover design there were no significant differences in total cholesterol ldlcholesterol and apob between the trans and the palmdiet hdlcholesterol and apoai were significantly higher on the palmdiet compared to the transdiet while the ratio of ldl to hdlcholesterol was lower although not significantly p  0077 on the palmdiet total cholesterol ldlcholesterol and apob were significantly lower on the pufadiet compared to the two other diets hdlcholesterol was not different on the palm and the pufadiet while it was significantly lower on the transdiet compared to the pufadiet triglycerides and lpa were not different among the three diets the diurnal postprandial state level of tissue plasminogen activator tpa activity was significantly decreased on the transdiet compared to the palmdiet tpa activity was also decreased on the pufadiet compared to palmdiet although not significantly p007 there were no significant differences in neither fasting levels or in circadian variation of tpa antigen pai1 activity pai1 antigen factor vii coagulant activity or fibrinogen between the three diets our results suggest that dietary palm oil may have a more favourable effect on the fibrinolytic system compared to partially hydrogenated soybean oil we conclude that from a nutritional point of view palmitic acid from palm oil may be a reasonable alternative to trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated soybean oil in margarine if the aim is to avoid trans fatty acids a palm oil based margarine is however less favourable than one based on a more polyunsaturated vegetable oil
objectives to study the association between content in adipose tissue of very longchain n3 fatty acids trans fatty acids linoleic acid and alphalinolenic acid and risk of a first myocardial infarction design and subjects a casecontrol design among 100 patients and 98 population controls both men and postmenopausal women age 4575 y adipose tissue fatty acids were determined by gasliquid chromatography intake data were obtained through interview using a validated food frequency questionnaire results dietary intake and adipose tissue content of the fatty acids studied correlated significantly adipose tissue contents of eicosapentaenoic acid 205n3 docosapentaenoic acid 225n3 and docosahexaenoic acid 226n3 were significantly lower while those of trans fatty acids linoleic and alphalinolenic acid were significantly higher in patients than in controls age and sex adjusted odds ratios or were significantly reduced with increasing quintiles of very longchain n3 fatty acids thus the or in the fifth compared to the first quintile was 023 95 ci 008070 after further adjustment for waisttohip ratio smoking family history of chd and content of trans fatty acids the or in the highest quintile was 017 95 ci 004076 and the p for trend 0016 age and sex adjusted or was increased in the fifth compared to the first quintile of trans fatty acids or 281 95 ci 116684 linoleic acid or 210 95 ci 087507 and alphalinolenic acid or 196 95 ci 083461 and p for trend was 0002 0005 and 0020 respectively the trends remained significant after adjustment for waisttohip ratio smoking and family history of coronary heart disease trans fatty acids linoleic acid and alphalinolenic acid in adipose tissue were strongly correlated indicating a common source most likely margarine when each of these fatty acid species were adjusted for the two others the trends were no longer significant conclusion intake of very longchain n3 fatty acids as reflected in adipose tissue content is inversely associated with risk of myocardial infarction trans fatty acids linoleic and alphalinolenic acid were intercorrelated and associated with increased risk it is suggested that the increased risk may be connected to trans fatty acids or to some other factor associated with margarine consumption

pelloso t 2001 margarines and spreads
margarines and spreads were introduced as lowcost replacements for butter many years ago although some margarines are still produced spreads are the predominant products in this category of products they have gone through many evolutionary changes since they were introduced more than six decades ago products have gone from the original 80 fat to 0 fat with varying degrees of success in the marketplace manufacturers of margarines and spreads have also taken advantage of the many new innovations in both the processing and the use of newer oils we have gone from the use of soycottonseed to all soy to the use of newer oils such as canola sunflower safflower and olive oil to name a few the coming of spreads and their preparation has also spearheaded advances in the emulsifier sector of the food industry even though it is much easier to make a fullfat 80 margarine than its lower fat version the availability of special high monoemulsifiers polyglycerol esters pge of regular or special fatty acids and other emulsifiers has made the preparation and processing easier further the availability of fat replacers gums and hydrocolloids has made it easier to satisfy the everincreasing need for lower fat products lower fat margarines better known as spreads have filled the need to reduce the fat intake recommended by the american heart association in the effort to lower lowdensity lipoproteins and incidence of cardiovascular disease further margarines and spreads have been under attack recently because they contain trans fatty acids the industry as a whole has done well in reducing the levels of this villain what is next for margarines and spreads are genetically modified organisms gmo the answer to hydrogenation are tropical oils an option what is worse saturates or trans will industry develop a special way to hydrogenate oils so as to minimize the trans level many of our colleagues are hard at work to solve some of these problems

the paper provides a review of the literature on a relevant nondrug prevention problem namely the negative effect of trans isomers of unsaturated fatty acids transufa on the risk of circulatory system diseases csd and other chronic noncommunicable diseases it gives data on the specific features of the structure and ability of transufa to elevate the plasma levels of atherogenic lowdensity lipoproteins and to lower those of nonantiatherogenic highdensity lipoproteins the natural sources of their moderate content in the animal fats from ruminants and those of their redundant content in the margarines manufactured by hydrogenation of liquid vegetable oils are described a new technology for preparing soft margarines spreads is presented which can produce fatty products that do not virtually contain transufa there is evidence that transufa can considerably raise the risk of csd and their acute complications it is concluded that the manufacture of fatty products with low and even no transufa levels should be expanded in russia to improve its populations health

there is a considerable overlap of trans fatty acid tfa isomers in fats of ruminant origin and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils phvos with many isomers in common however there is a considerable difference in the amount of individual tfas in both sources at present it is uncertain as to which components of tfas created by chemical hydrogenation are responsible for their negative metabolic effects there is evidence of unfavourable effects of tfas from hydrogenated vegetable oils on ldl and other risk factors of atherosclerosis there is no evidence that the predominant tfa in milk vaccenic acid exerts these unfavourable effects prospective studies addressing the effect of tfa intake on coronary heart disease risk whose estimate of tfa intake was based on dietary protocols were mostly carried out in populations with a relatively low intake of dairy or ruminant tfas nevertheless several of them showed a significantly or nonsignificantly decreased risk with increasing intake of animal tfas or at least no increased risk up to now there is no human study available that investigates the effect of different tfas under ceteris paribus conditions isoenergetic diets with otherwise identical fatty acid profile by now the production of milk fat samples differing mainly in tfa content is feasible and would allow such controlled intervention studies c 2006 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
plant sterols are an essential component of the membranes of all eukaryotic organisms they are either synthesised de novo or taken up from the environment their function appears to be to control membrane fluidity and permeability although some plant sterols have a specific function in signal transduction the phytosterols are products of the isoprenoid pathway the dedicated pathway to sterol synthesis in photosynthetic plants occurs at the squalene stage through the activity of squalene synthetase although the activity of 3hydroxymethyl3glutaryl coenzyme a hgmr is ratelimiting in the synthesis of cholesterol this does not appear to be the case with the plant sterols upregulation of hgmr appears to increase the biosynthesis of cycloartenol but not the delta5sterols a decline in sterol synthesis is associated with a suppression of squalene synthetase activity which is probably a critical point in controlling carbon flow and endproduct formation the major postsqualene biosynthetic pathway is regulated by critical ratelimiting steps such as the methylation of cycloartenol into cycloeucalenol little is known about the factors controlling the biosynthesis of the endpoint sterol esters or stanols the commonly consumed plant sterols are sitosterol stigmasterol and campesterol which are predominantly supplied by vegetable oils the oils are a rich source of the steryl esters less important sources of sterols are cereals nuts and vegetables the nutritional interest derives from the fact that the sterols have a similar structure to cholesterol and have the capacity to lower plasma cholesterol and ldl cholesterol since the morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease have been dramatically reduced using cholesterollowering drugs statins the interest in plant sterols lies in their potential to act as a natural preventive dietary product stanols saturated at c5 occur in low amounts in the diet and are equally effective in lowering plasma cholesterol and do not cause an increase in plasma levels unlike the sterols which can be detected in plasma c 2000 society of chemical industry

polymorphisms in the atp binding cassette abc transporters abcg5 and abcg8 are related to plasma plant sterol concentrations it is not known whether these polymorphisms are also associated with variations in serum plant sterol concentrations during interventions affecting plant sterol metabolism we therefore decided to study changes in serum plant sterol concentrations with abcg5g8 polymorphisms after consumption of plant stanol esters which decrease plasma plant sterol concentrations cholesterolstandardized serum campesterol and sitosterol concentrations were significantly associated with the abcg8 t400k genotype as were changes in serum plant sterol concentrations after consumption of plant stanols the reduction of 571  383 102 x mumolmmol cholesterol for sitosterol in tt subjects was significantly greater compared with the 360  187 reduction in subjects with the tk genotype p  0021 and the 169  130 reduction in subjects with the kk genotype p  0047 changes in serum campesterol concentrations showed a comparable association no association with serum ldl cholesterol was found genetic variation in abcg8 not only explains crosssectional differences in serum plant sterol concentrations but also determines a subjects responsiveness to changes in serum plant sterols during interventions known to affect plant sterol metabolism

functional foods enriched with plant sterols and stanols are on sale in many countries due to their structural similarity with cholesterol these additives lower intestinal absorption of cholesterol resulting in a 1015 reduction in ldlcholesterol when their daily intakes are 23 g they are also effective as part of a cholesterollowering diet and in combination with cholesterollowering drugs estimates for the absorption of plant sterols sitosterol and campesterol and of campestanol are around 10 and for sitostanol less than 5 lipidstandardized plasma levels are very low but increase when statins are used extensive toxicological evaluation studies have not revealed any harmful sideeffects in human studies sideeffects were comparable to placebo treatment however lipidstandardized levels of the hydrocarbon carotenoids may decrease without leaving the normal range together these findings indicate that these functional foods have great potential in the prevention of coronary heart disease however postmarketing surveillance for example for functional foods in general is necessary to monitor possible adverse effects and describe consumers and consumption patterns c 2001 medikal press

incorporation of plant stanol esters into margarine is among the first examples of a functional food with proven lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterollowering effectiveness recently there have been many studies on the effects of plant stanolssterols on cholesterol metabolism it has been found that the serum ldl cholesterollowering effect of plant stanolssterols originates from reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption a process in which changes in micellar composition are thought to play a major role however recent findings suggest that there is an additional process in which plant stanolssterols actively influence cellular cholesterol metabolism within intestinal enterocytes furthermore in response to the reduced supply of exogenous cholesterol receptormediated lipoprotein cholesterol uptake is probably enhanced as shown by increased ldl receptor expression at recommended intakes of about 2 to 25 gday products enriched with plant stanolsterol esters lower plasma ldl cholesterol levels by 10 to 14 without any reported side effects thus plant stanolssterols can be considered to be effective and safe cholesterollowering functional food ingredients c 2005 elsevier inc all rights reserved

the organic product label guarantees a production process that avoids the use of synthetic fertilisers pesticides and hormones and minimises recourse to pharmaceuticals or veterinary drugs however the products quality remains an issue that needs to be addressed in response to consumer demand consequently this study was conducted to compare the sensory and nutritional qualities of meat and carcasses from pasturefed lambs reared organically o or conventionally c mean lamb growth profile was kept similar between the two treatments to avoid confounding effects with lamb age or weight at slaughter the experiment was conducted over 3 years 2005 to 2007 with 12 o and 12 c lambs each year the o and c treatments differed in the level of onpasture mineral n fertilisation inducing a higher proportion of white clover in the organic pasture than the conventional pasture lambs were slaughtered when they attained a fat class of 2 to 3 and carcass and meat quality were evaluated lambs were slaughtered at an average weight and age of 353 kg and 156 days in the o treatment respectively and 352 kg and 155 days in the c treatment respectively sensory evaluation indicated that loin chops from the o treatment had a higher level of abnormal fat odour compared with the c treatment carcasses from the o treatment had a softer subcutaneous fat one among 3 years 2007 compared to the c treatment these results are probably due to a higher proportion of white clover in the diet organically reared lambs did offer the slight advantage of muscle fatty acid containing a higher level of stearic acid which may have positive effects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in humans this may be the result of a higher rumen biohydrogenation of c18 3n3 due to differences in the botanical composition between the o and the c pasture production system had no effect on the colour characteristics of the meat and subcutaneous fat except lightness of subcutaneous dorsal fat which was slightly higher in the o lambs there were no differences between o and c lambs in terms of colour stability and lipid oxidation of the meat during the 6day refrigerated storage under gaspermeable film

although trans fatty acids of natural origin have obviously been a part of our diet for a long time exposure to transfatty acids has changed with the industrial hardening of vegetable oils trans fatty acids of natural origin are found in milk fat and in the meat of ruminants and products made from them they are produced primarily through biohydrogenation in the rumen trans fatty acids of industrial source are produced during partial hydrogenation and deodorisation of vegetable oils natural and industrial trans fatty acids share common features but differ in their trans fatty acid distribution it is now thought that trans fatty acids made from fats of industrial origin may enhance unfavourable risk factors for coronary heart disease natural and industrial trans fatty acids contain many structurally identical compounds so that it would be expected that the physiological effects would be similar there have been few studies comparing the patterns of trans fatty acids natural versus industrial and their physiological effects the contents of trans fatty acids in commercially available plant margarines has significantly decreased in the last two decades the results of the state monitoring plan of 2008 showed however that there are other problematical food groups and these counteract the desired reduction in the intake of industrial trans fatty acids national authorities in some other countries have demonstrated that a general reduction in industrial trans fatty acids in our foods can be achieved by regulation

dietary trans fatty acids tfa are of major concern because of their adverse effects on blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease in canada margarines were significant sources of tfa during the 1980s and 1990s however this is expected to change with increased public awareness over their adverse health effects and the introduction of new legislature to include tfa content on the nutritional facts table of food labels in this study the tfa content of the topselling 29 canadian margarines which represented 963 of the market share was determined by capillary gasliquid chromatography in order to assess the influence of regulatory development during the 3year transition period between the announcement of new food labelling regulations in canada that require mandatory declaration of the trans fat content in most prepackaged foods in january 2003 and its enforcement on 12 december 2005 the 29 margarines included 15 tub margarines made from nonhydrogenated vegetable oils nhvotub margarines 11 tub margarines made from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils phvotub margarines and three print margarines which were also made from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils phvoprint margarines the 15 nhvo tubmargarines accounted for 71 of the total margarine market share and generally contained less than 2 tfa mean value 09  03 of total fatty acids the mean total tfa contents of phvotub margarines and phvoprint margarines were 200  45 and 396  35 and their market shares were 193 and 60 respectively although during the last 10 years increasing number of soft tub margarines that contained very little trans fats have been made available in canada the phvotub and print margarines still contain high levels of trans fats similar to those margarines that were sold in the 1990s the market share data suggest that the margarines prepared using nhvo and containing almost no tfa were preferred by canadians over those margarines prepared using phvo even before the mandatory declaration of tfa content came into effect on 12 december 2005
research conducted in the mid1990s indicated that the levels of trans fats in canadian diets were among the highest in the world the consumption of trans fats raises blood levels of lowdensity lipoprotein ldlcholesterol while reducing levels of highdensity lipoprotein hdlcholesterol in june 2007 health canada called on the food industry to voluntarily reduce levels of trans fats in vegetable oils and soft tubmargarines to 2 of total fat and in all other foods to 5 industry must show satisfactory progress by june 2009 or health canada might have to introduce legislation to ensure that recommended limits are achieved since 2005 health canada has been performing a national assessment of prepackaged and restaurant foods that likely contain trans fats from 2005 to 20091120 samples were analyzed of which 852 or approximately 76 met the recommended trans fat limits as a result of reformulation most of the products had decreased trans  saturated fat content the estimated average intake of trans fatty acids tfa in canada significantly dropped from the high value of 84 gday in the mid1990s to 34 gday or 14 food energy in 2008 however this tfa intake of 14 of energy is still above the world health organization recommended limit of tfa intake of 1 of energy which suggests that the canadian food industry needs to put more effort into reducing the tfa content in its products especially in tubmargarines donuts and bakery products
there is increased acceptance of fortifying habitual foods with plant sterols and their saturated derivatives stanols at levels that are considered safe these sterols and stanols are recognized as potentially effective dietary components for lowering plasma total and ldl cholesterol our previous studies have shown that daily consumption of plant sterols promotes strokes and shortens the life span of strokeprone spontaneously hypertensive shrsp rats these studies question the safety of plant sterol additives the present study was performed to determine whether a large intake of plant stanols would cause nutritional effects similar to those seen with plant sterols in shrsp rats young shrsp rats aged 2629 d were fed semipurified diets containing commercial margarines fortified with either plant stanols 11 g100 g diet or plant sterols 14 g100 g diet a reference group of shrsp rats was fed a soybean oil diet 002 g plant sterols100 g diet and no plant stanols compared to soybean oil both plant stanol and plant sterol margarines significantly p  005 reduced the life span of shrsp rats at the initial stages of feeding there was no difference in the survival rates between the two margarine groups but after approximately 50 d of feeding the plant stanol group had a slightly but significantly p  005 lower survival rate blood and tissue plasma red blood cells liver and kidney concentrations of plant sterols in the plant sterol margarine group were three to four times higher than the corresponding tissue concentrations of plant stanols in the plant stanol group the deformability of red blood cells and the platelet count of shrsp rats fed the plant sterol margarine were significantly p  005 lower than those of the plant stanol margarine and soybean oil groups at the end of the study these parameters did not differ between the soybean oil and plant stanol margarine groups these results suggest that at the levels tested in the present study plant stanols provoke hemorrhagic stroke in shrsp rats to a slightly greater extent than plant sterols the results also suggest that the mechanism by which plant stanols shorten the life span of shrsp rats might differ from that of plant sterols
reddy s y and t jeyarani 2001 transfree bakery shortenings from mango kernel and mahua fats by fractionation and blending journal of the american oil chemists society 786 635640
bakery shortenings prepared by hydrogenation contain high levels or trans fatty acids which are considered to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease the shortenings prepared from mango kernel and mahua fats have no trans fatty acids mahua fat was fractionated by dry fractionation to obtain a highmelting fraction 10 yield mh1 mango rat was fractionated by twostage solvent fractionation separating about 15 highmelting fraction mk1 in the first stage followed by 40 stearin mk2 in the second stage the formulation containing 80 mh1 and 20 of mango middle stearin fraction mk2 showed melting characteristics and onset and enthalpy of crystallization similar to those of commercial hydrogenated shortenings designed for cakes and biscuits the formulation suitable for purr pastry shortening was prepared by blending 50 mango 1st stearin mk1 and 50 mahua fat with addition of 57 of fully hydrogenated vegetable oil the formulations having melting characteristics similar to those of commercial cake and biscuit shortenings were also prepared by blending 40 mango rat and 60 mahua rat with 57 incorporation of fully hydrogenated peanut oil however these formulations showed delayed transition to the stable forms compared to those of commercial samples fatty acid composition revealed that commercial hydrogenated shortenings consisted of 1829 trans oleic acid whereas the formulations we prepared did not contain any trans acids the iodine values of commercial samples were 5758 whereas the value for the formulations prepared were 4753 the consistency of the prepared samples as measured by cone penetrometer was slightly harder than commercial samples these studies showed that it is possible to prepare bakery shortenings with no trans fatty acids by using mango and mahua fats and their fractions
stanol ester dissolved in margarine inhibits cholesterol absorption in general and despite increasing cholesterol synthesis decreases serum total and lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels but its effects on postprandial lipid metabolism are unknown we performed fat tolerance tests in 11 men at baseline and during shortterm stanol ester consumption without and with stanol esters added to the test meal also containing retinol and squalene cholesterol triglycerides retinyl palmitate and squalene were analyzed in plasma chylomicrons and verylowdensity lipoprotein vldl at baseline and 3 4 6 9 12 and 24 hours after the test meal serum total and ldl cholesterol only tended to diminish after the 2week stanol ester consumption however the proportion of plasma plant sterol and cholesterolprecursor sterol to cholesterol was significantly altered suggesting that cholesterol absorption was diminished and cholesterol synthesis was increased postprandial peak times of squalene and retinyl palmitate in plasma chylomicrons and vldl were significantly reduced by stanol esters but their concentrations in chylomicrons were unchanged stanol esters reduced the vldl squalene peak concentration by 23 p 05 and the incremental area under the curve auic in plasma and vldl by 22 and 32 p 01 for both chylomicron remnant metabolism measured with triglycerides only tended to diminish the effects of stanol esters in the diet only and both in the diet and with supplementation did not differ significantly we conclude that dietary stanol esters reduce postprandial lipoproteins measured with dietary retinyl palmitate and especially squalene and the reduction is observed even though serum total and ldl cholesterol are only inconsistently decreased after shortterm stanol ester consumption copyright c 2000 by wb saunders company
stearoylcoa desaturase scd is a key enzyme that determines the composition and metabolic fate of ingested fatty acids in particular the conversion of transvaccenic acid tva to conjugated linoleic acid cla the present study addressed the hypothesis that intestinal tva absorption and biotransformation into cla can be modulated by epa and 310dithia stearic acid dsa via altered scd mrna levels and desaturation indices cis9 trans11clatva and oleic acidstearic acid ratios in caco2 and t84 cells two wellestablished in vitro models of the human intestinal epithelium the study determined the effect of acute 3 h with 03 mmepa or 03 mmdsa and acuteonchronic 1 week with 003 mmepa or dsa followed by respectively 03 mmepa or dsa for 3 h treatments in both cell lines acute epa treatment did not alter scd desaturation indices whereas the acuteonchronic treatment affected these surrogate markers of scd activity this was associated with reduced sterol regulatoryelement binding protein1c and scd mrna levels in contrast acute and acuteonchronic dsa treatments significantly reduced scd desaturation indices without affecting scd mrna levels in caco2 cells the present study on intestinal cells shows that the conversion rate of tva to c9 t11cla is affected by other fatty acids present in the diet such as epa confirming previous observations in hepatic and mammary cell models

conjugated linoleic acids cla are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa some isomers occurring naturally in beef and dairy products and others being formed as a result of bihydrogenation of vegetable oils to form margarine synthetic and natural sources of cla may have beneficial effects in a range of inflammatory conditions including colitis atherosclerosis metabolic syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis most of the biological effects have been attributed to the cis9 trans11c9 t11 and the trans10 cis12 t10 c12 isomers evidence suggests that c9 t11cla is responsible for the antiinflammatory effect attributed to cla while t10 t12cla appears to be responsible for antiadipogenic effects this review will focus on the effects of cla on the inflammatory components associated with insulin resistance atherosclerosis and th1 mediated inflammatory disease at a cellular systemic and clinical level whist cla may ameliorate certain aspects of the inflammatory response particularly within cellular and animal models the relevance of this has yet to be clarified within the context of human health c 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
trans fatty acids were recently included in the list of dietetic lipids acting as risk factors for coronary artery disease in addition these compounds have been related to the etiology of various metabolic and functional disorders controversial questions concerning the role of trans fatty acids in catering have resulted in progressive modifications to the legislation and hence to industrial practices related to the production of fat bases for application in foods thus the search for zero trans fats has led researchers to test different raw materials and processes that could make a wide range of fats available for different industrial ends interesterification offers an important alternative to the partial hydrogenation process traditionally employed to modify the behavior of fats and oils without however causing the formation of trans isomers this chapter covers aspects related to interesterification processes and their effects on the physicochemical properties of fats and oils methods for obtaining interesterified fat bases from different raw materials and their combinations the instrumental methodology associated with the analysis of interesterified fats and the industrial application design for these compounds are also presented in detail and discussed
objective to examine the effect of the new canadian labelling regulations on the fat composition and prices of margarines study design a survey of all margarines sold in major supermarkets in the greater toronto area was conducted in 2006 and results were compared with those of a similar survey conducted in 2002 average fat composition proportion of trans fatfree margarines and average prices of margarines were compared a general linear model procedure was used to compare the relationship between price and fat composition in 2002 and 2006 results average amounts of trans fatty acids tfa and mufa decreased while average amounts of pufa increased significantly from 2002 to 2006 the proportion of margarines with less than 02g tfa10g serving rose significantly from 31 in 2002 to 69 in 2006 margarines lower in tfa on average cost significantly more than margarines with greater amounts of these fats and this relationship appeared stronger in 2006 relative to 2002 conclusions there is evidence of reductions in tfa in margarines since new labelling regulations came into effect in canada however tfa reductions appeared to be restricted to higherpriced margarines results suggest that voluntary approaches ie manufacturer incentives via labelling to reduce population intakes of tfa will yield little changes in tfa content of lowcost products and thus may have limited benefit for lowerincome groups who are at higher risk of heart disease

the objective of this study was to analyse the trans fatty acid tfa content of a selection of foods sold on the swiss market in order to get an overview of the situation and to find indicators to assess the origins of tfa 119 food items from different food groups were purchased in the city of zurich and analysed for their tfa content with gas chromatography tfa were detected in all but two samples and the content ranged from 0 to 29 of the total fat nearly 40 of the analysed samples had more than 2 tfa the highest mean value was observed in the fine bakery products 6 tfa and the lowest with the breakfast cereals 04 tfa transc181 was the predominant tfa in all samples except for the plant oils in which transc182 and transc183 isomers made up the bigger part of the total tfa content an analytical distinction of the tfas according to their origin seems possible when concomitantly considering the amounts of t11c181 c9t11c182 and total tfa the situation regarding the tfa content in swiss food was similar to many other countries worldwide c 2009 elsevier inc all rights reserved
although type 2 diabetes is determined primarily by lifestyle and genes dietary composition may affect both its development and complications dietary fat is of particular interest because fatty acids influence glucose metabolism by altering cell membrane function enzyme activity insulin signaling and gene expression this paper focuses on the prevention of type 2 diabetes and summarizes the epidemiologic literature on associations between types of dietary fat and diabetes risk it also summarizes controlled feeding studies on the effects of dietary fats on metabolic mediators such as insulin resistance taken together the evidence suggests that replacing saturated fats and trans fatty acids with unsaturated polyunsaturated andor monounsaturated fats has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and is likely to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes among polyunsaturated fats linoleic acid from the n6 series improves insulin sensitivity on the other hand longchain n3 fatty acids do not appear to improve insulin sensitivity or glucose metabolism in dietary practice foods rich in vegetable oils including nonhydrogenated margarines nuts and seeds should replace foods rich in saturated fats from meats and fatrich dairy products consumption of partially hydrogenated fats should be minimized additional controlled longterm studies are needed to improve our knowledge on the optimal proportion of different types of fats to prevent diabetes c 2008 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the everincreasing amount of trans fatty acids in the human diet has been linked to a variety of afflictions most notably coronary heart disease and arteriosclerosis the mechanism of why the replacement of cis fatty acids with their trans counterparts can be detrimental to the health of an individual remains a mystery here we compare the differences in membrane physical properties including molecular dynamics lateral lipid packing thermotropic phase behavior fluidity lateral mobility and permeability between model membranes lipid monolayers and bilayers composed of cis and transcontaining phosphatidylcholines pcs the pcs tested have a total of zero one two or four cis oleic or linoleic or trans elaidic or linoelaidic double bonds these experiments all confirm the basic hypothesis that trans fatty acids produce membrane properties more similar to those of saturated chains than to those of acyl chains containing cis double bonds ie cis double bonds induce much larger membrane perturbations than trans double bonds
roberts d c k 1991 dietary factors in the fall in coronary heartdisease mortality prostaglandins leukotrienes and essential fatty acids 442 97101
the role of dietary change in the fall in heart disease mortality has been hotly debated three countries australia usa and uk with equal care and sophistication of surgical techniques have shown different timing in the beginning of the decline of this epidemic around the mid 1960s in the first two countries but not until the late 1970s for the uk the cause of this difference may be the changing food habits of their populations using food disappearance data apparent consumption of butter and margarine show opposite trends butter down and margarine up predating the decline in mortality in both the usa and australia by at least 7 years and also in the uk but at a later time about 1970 changes in adipose tissue linoleate a marker for polyunsaturated fat intake support this indirect evidence with depot levels rising in the usa from the 1960s and 10 years later in the uk other evidence supports the view of decreasing saturated fat intake and increasing polyunsaturated intake prior to 1960 in the usa although many factors must contribute to the decline in mortality from chd change in dietary ps ratio would seem to be the major dietary contributor
trans isomers of unsaturated fatty acids are formed by biological or industrial hydrogenation a population casecontrol study of sudden cardiac death in men was done to test the hypothesis that trans isomers of oleic acid and linoleic acid increase the risk of sudden cardiac death due to coronary artery disease in adipose tissue obtained at necropsy from 66 cases of sudden cardiac death and taken from 286 healthy age and sex matched controls the proportions of trans isomers of oleic and linoleic acid were measured by gasliquid chromatography in cases the mean se percentage of total trans fatty acids c181 plus c182 expressed as a proportion of all fatty acids was significantly lower 268 008 than in healthy controls 286 004 p005 trans c181 was 21 07 in cases compared with 227 004 p005 in controls the proportion of all trans isomers of linoleic acid was 058 002 in cases compared with 059 001 in controls p098 the estimated relative risk for sudden cardiac death of trans c181 and c182 fatty acids combined did not differ significantly from 10 in relation to the distribution of these trans isomers by quintile in the control population the relative risk 95 ci of sudden cardiac death in the top quintile was 040 015102 for c181 and 108 048274 for c182 compared with the bottom quintiles of their respective control distributions when these univariate relations for irans fatty acids were adjusted for coronary risk factors smoking was the only factor that remained independently associated with risk of sudden cardiac death 227 123417 overall there was no evidence of a relation between trans isomers of oleic and linoleic acids combined and sudden cardiac death however trans oleic acid was negatively associated with risk of sudden cardiac death whereas no association with trans forms of linoleic acid was seen this study does not support the hypothesis that trans isomers increase the risk of sudden cardiac death
conjugated linoleic acid isomers cla have been reported to exert anticarcinogenic effects protection against atherosclerosis and decrease of body fat among others effects in both animals and humans however the mechanism of action of cla remains still unknown with various proposed pathways moreover previous works have reported ambiguous results and contradictory effects the c182t10c12 has been associated elsewhere to deleterious bioactivities according to this further data are needed to unravel the biological activities of cla the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cla as part of the diet of adult hamsters in reversing hypercholesterolemia a risk factor associated with atherosclerosis the hypercholesterolemic condition was induced in male syrian golden hamsters then divided into three groups receiving cla premixed in the diet diet cla1 administered separately through gavage as cla oil diet cla2 or not added cd control diet all diets contained 01 cholesterol and were equivalent in lipid content blood physiological parameters lipid profile glucose liver enzymes and body weight were monitored weekly after 35 days hamsters fed cla2 diet reduced in great extension the body weight while cla1 was more effective in lowering the concentration of triglycerides in plasma liver functions and glycemic status were not affected the main outcomes of the present research work are that cla in the form of oil or added to powder milk does not cause toxic effects or alter live functions or glycemia in hamsters furthermore the results suggest that cia formulated as a skimmed milk powder product can reverse hypercholesterolemic risk factors while high cia oils is useful for weight control c 2012 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

cholesterol is an essential lipid for mammalian life but a high cholesterol level can almost guarantee the eventual onset of vascular diseases and in some cases can lead to death it has been shown that there is a direct connection between hih cholesterol levels and vascular diseases some methods for lowering the serum cholesterol level thereby preventing the development of these diseases have been developed and those include drugs and food additives since both drugs and food additives act to inhibit the uptake of cholesterol understanding the sterol absorption process is the key to understanding exactly how drugs and food additives reduce serum cholesterol levels the major drawback of using anticholesterol drugs is related to their side effects and therefore natural food additives called plant sterols phytosterols have been developed as an attractive alternative phytosterols are sterols that are synthesized only in plants and that are structurally similar to cholesterol but with the inclusion of art extra hydrophobic carbon chain at the c24 position phytosterols and their esters reduce cholesterol level in the blood in spite of the fact that they are poorly absorbed into the blood stream the mechanism by which phytosterolsphytosterol esters interfere with cholesterol absorption is not completely clear but based on the present understanding three distinct features have been recognized 1 physicochemical effects eg competitive solubilization and cocrystallization 2 effects at the absorption site eg hydrolysis by lipases and esterases 3 effects on intracellular trafficking of sterols due to phytosterols poor solubilization in oil and water they must be taken in high doses to achieve a reduction in cholesterol level one of the goals of the food and pharmaceutical industries therefore is to develop products that effectuate the same decrease in cholesterol level but in smaller sterol doses achieved by increasing sterol bioavailability the first line of products to meet the increased bioavailability criterion was the oilsoluble esterified phytosterols combined with fatty acids which exhibit solubility in oil 10 times higher than that of pure phytosterols the three primary methods of phytosterol inclusion in food are suspension precipitation and microemulsion c 2005 elsevier bv all rights reserved
lipasecatalyzed interesterification of butterfat blended with rapeseed oil 7030 ww was investigated both in batch and in continuous reactions six commercially available immobilized lipases were screened in batch experiments and the lipases lipozyme tl im and lipozyme rm im were chosen for further studies in a continuous packed bed reactor tl im gave a fast reaction and had almost reached equilibrium with a residence time of 30 min whereas rm im required 60 min the effect of reaction temperature was more pronounced for rm im tl im showed little effect on the interesterification degree when the temperature was raised from 60 degrees c to 90 degrees c whereas rm im had a positive effect when the temperature was increased from 40 degrees c to 80 degrees c even though tl im is an sn13 specific lipase small changes in the sn2 position of the triacylglycerol could be seen the tendency was toward a reduction of the saturated fatty acid c140 and c160 and an increase of the longchain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids c180 and c181 especially at longer residence times 90 min in prolonged continuous operation the activity of tl im was high for the first 5 days whereafter it dramatically decreased over the next 10 days to an activity level of 40 in general the study shows no significant difference for butterfat interesterification in terms of enzyme behavior from normal vegetable oils and fats even though it contains shortchain fatty acids and cholesterol however the release of shortchain fatty acids from enzymatic reactions makes the sensory quality unacceptable for direct edible applications

widespread recognition of the negative health effects of trans and saturated fats has prompted research to develop alternative structures that can structure liquid oils into semisolid plastic pastes for food applications we have recently developed and described the physical chemical properties of a unique a monostearinoilwater gel mag that achieves this goal furthermore ingestion of this mac in the form of a margarinelike spread resulted in beneficial suppression of blood lipid and insulin responses in humans compared to compositionallyequivalent controls lacking the mac structure however the integrity of this novel structure and its salubrious metabolic effects have not been previously evaluated under food processing conditions the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the integrity of the mac when applied to toasted bread and when mixed with a warm pasta meal and to evaluate the metabolic effects over 6 h following ingestion of both types of meals with mac compared to compositionallyequivalent unstructured oil preparations mac structure was maintained in the toast study but the pasta meal destroyed the mac structure triglyceride free fatty acid and insulin responses were suppressed in the mac trial compared to the unstructured oil trial of the toast study whereas there was no difference in the responses of these variables between the two trials in the pasta study the results demonstrate for the first time that the metabolic effects of mac depend on maintenance of the mac structural integrity throughout the food processing procedures leading up to ingestion thus this study demonstrates the utility of mac as a trans and saturated fatfree vehicle to structure and deliver liquid oil as a semisolid plastic paste and establishes processing limits to the integrity of the additional beneficial metabolic effects of this novel structure c 2008 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
cardiovascular and metabolic health concerns have led to interest in development of saturated and trans fatfree margarines spreads and other foods we have recently characterized a novel monoglyceride gel mag gel that can structure liquid oil into a semiplastic solid consistency in the absence of saturated and trans fats consumption of this mag gel resulted in tempered postprandial metabolic responses compared to those resulting from consumption of a compositionally equivalent but unstructured oil suspension suggesting a structuredependent metabolic response the current study was designed to test the hypothesis that postprandial blood lipid and metabolite responses to mag gel would be tempered compared to the responses after ingestion of butter and tubmargarine of equal total fat content indeed blood triglyceride response was tempered in mag gel compared to butter margarine and unstructured oil trials all of which produced similar triglyceride responses the blood free fatty acid glucose and insulin responses were not different in mag gel compared to butter or margarine trials and interestingly there were no differences between butter and margarine trials for any of the metabolic response variables the mag gel is a useful structure for many applications and produces salubrious postprandial metabolic effects compared to other spreadable fats c 2009 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

background in a recent sixyear followup study we found that frequent consumption of nuts was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic heart disease to explore possible explanations for this finding we studied the effects of nut consumption on serum lipids and blood pressure methods we randomly placed 18 healthy men on two mixed natural diets each diet to be followed for four weeks both diets conformed to the national cholesterol education program step 1 diet and contained identical foods and macronutrients except that 20 percent of the calories of one diet the walnut diet were derived from walnuts offset by lesser amounts of fatty foods meat and visible fat oils margarine and butter results with the reference diet the mean sd serum values for total lowdensity lipoprotein ldl and highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol were respectively 18223 11216 and 4711 mg per deciliter 471059 290041 and 122028 mmol per liter with the walnut diet the mean total cholesterol level was 224 mg per deciliter 058 mmol per liter lower than the mean level with the reference diet 95 percent confidence interval 28 to 17 mg per deciliter 072 to 044 mmol per liter the ldl and hdl cholesterol levels were respectively 182 mg per deciliter 047 mmol per liter p0001 and 23 mg per deciliter 006 mmol per liter p  001 lower these lower values represented reductions of 124 163 and 49 percent in the levels of total ldl and hdl cholesterol respectively the ratio of ldl cholesterol to hdl cholesterol was also lowered p0001 by the walnut diet mean bloodpressure values did not change during either dietary period conclusions incorporating moderate quantities of walnuts into the recommended cholesterollowering diet while maintaining the intake of total dietary fat and calories decreases serum levels of total cholesterol and favorably modifies the lipoprotein profile in normal men the longterm effects of walnut consumption and the extension of this finding to other population groups deserve further study
phytonutrients can be found in fruits and the avocado contains four times more betasitosterol phytosterol and it is one of the best glutathione sources the phytosterol is a vegetable substance whose structure is very similar to the cholesterol one and its action mechanism involves the intestinal inhibition of cholesterol absorption and the synthesis of hepatic cholesterol the effect has an influence on the values of total plasmatic cholesterol and ldl without affecting the levels of hdl and triglycerides the present work had the objective to analyze the influence of the consumption of the hass avocado on the levels of total cholesterol hdl ldl triglycerides and hepatic and excreted cholesterol these parameters were investigated in hipercholesterolemic wistar rats during 30 and 60 days of experiment at the end of 30 days the 15 avocado diet reduced the levels of total cholesterol and ldl in comparison to the control it was observed that for the excreted cholesterol the best diet was the 25 of avocado since the cholesterol excretion increased with the increase of the avocado concentration the 15 avocado diet also influenced the levels of hepatic cholesterol
fish oil concentrates fluid or in capsules have shown beneficial effects on several risk factors for cardiovasular disease but their use implies addition of fat to the diet in order to overcome this substitution of fish oil for other fat in a food product was tried in the present investigation the effects of a small dose of fish oil substituted for margarine in bread on plasma phospholipid fatty acids and serum triglycerides were determined in a parallel singleblinded randomized study in 17 healthy subjects daily intake of 1 g stable fish oil containing 38 percent n3 fatty acids eskimo3r for 4 weeks increased longchain n3 fatty acids it plasma phospholipids by almost 50 percent p005 and decreased serum triglycerides by 17 percent p  0005 plasma alphatocopherol and tears thiobarbituric acid reactive substances measured as malondialdehyde a marker of lipid peroxidation and blood glucose were unchanged in a blinded consumer sensory test only 2 out of 195 subjects perceived any taste of fish aroma in the bread containing fish oil this study showed that by use of a stable fish oil preparation it is possible to substitute fish oil for margarine in bread a food product consumed in large amounts and that a small amount of this fish oil has significant effects on blood lipids without any signs of lipid peroxidation c 1998 elsevier science inc

the role of trans fatty acids tfa present in partially hydrogenated fats widely consumed in food and their link with coronary heart disease has been examined in this review most of the studies carried out have been on the effects of tfa on bloodlipid profile the perceived effects of tfa intake depend on the fat or oil with which they are compared and appears to be in between that of dietary saturated fats and monounsaturated fatty acids when compared to saturated fat tfa intake shows lower levels of total and ldlcholesterol in blood but when both tfa and saturated fatty acids are compared with cis fatty acids or native unhydrogenated oil increase in total and ldlcholesterol are noted the effects of tfa on hdl cholesterol and lpa are not clearly established the undesirable effects of tfa can be overcome by inclusion of essential fatty acids at a minimum of 2 energy per cent level in the diet the link between trans fatty acid intake and coronary heart disease chd are not unequivocally established
objectives elaidic acid the predominant transfatty acid in industrially hydrogenated oils exists on high levels in iranian hydrogenated oils and margarines this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of elaidic acid and its ciscounterpart oleic acid on expression of icam1 and vcam1 on human bone marrow endothelial cells hbmecs design and methods hbmec were pretreated with tnfalpha or lps for induction of the adhesion molecules expression and then treated with elaidic acid or oleic acid soluble and cell associated forms of icam1 and vcam1 were quantified by elisa and western blot results our findings indicated that oleic acid suppresses vcam1 and icam1 expression on hbmec near to the basal level conversely elaidic acid maintained the level of vcam1 and icam1 upregulated by tnfalpha or lps conclusions it is suggested that elaidic acid could keep the hbmec at the stimulated phenotype these findings provide further support on the detrimental effects of elaidic acid in promotion and induction of cardiovascular diseases cvd c 2010 the canadian society of clinical chemists published by elsevier inc all rights reserved
phytosterols are plant sterols structurally similar to cholesterol the most common phytosterols are bsitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol they are present in many foods but mainly in nuts and vegetable oils they compete with cholesterol absorption decreasing the cardiovascular risk recent studies have associated the intake of 0633gday of phytosterols with lowering serum cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels the same decrease has been observed in apolipoprotein b these results suggest that dietary phytosterols are useful for protection against cardiovascular disease because of this they have been incorporated in relatively high quantities into spreads and margarines however negative effects have also been reported among them a significant decrease in the absorption of several lypophilic antioxidant compounds such as carotenoids and tocopherols which may counterbalance the protective cardiovascular effect of phytosterols in this paper the results of several selected studies relating phytosterol consumption and plasma levels of lipids lipoproteins and antioxidants are reviewed more studies are needed to establish if it is necessary to supplement with such antioxidant compounds the diet of people consuming phytosterols for therapeutical purposes

objective transfatty acids tfas are formed during partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils and are shown to be more atherogenic than saturated fatty acids sfas our previous study showed that dietary tfas decrease adipose tissue insulin sensitivity to a greater extent than sfas in rats we hypothesized that the effects of these fatty acids on insulin sensitivity could be mediated through an alteration in gene expression in the current study we have investigated the effects of dietary tfas or sfas on expression of genes associated with insulin sensitivity in rat adipose tissue design and methods male weanling wistarnin rats were divided into four groups and fed one of the following diets containing 10 fat g100g diet differing only in the fatty acid composition for 3 months control diet 37 linoleic acid la sfa diet 5 sfa tfa diet 1 15 tfa  1 la and tfa diet 2 15 tfa  2 la the mrna expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma ppar gamma lipoprotein lipase lpl glucose transporter4 glut4 resistin and adiponectin was analyzed in epididymal fat using rtpcr the effects of tfa were studied at two levels of la to understand the beneficial effects of la over the effects of tfa results both dietary sfa and tfa upregulated the mrna levels of resistin dietary sfa downregulated adiponectin and glut4 and upregulated lpl while tfa downregulated ppar gamma and lpl the effects of dietary tfa on ppar gamma and resistin were not counteracted by increased la tfa diet 2 conclusion the effects of sfas on the aforementioned genes except ppar gamma could be extrapolated towards decreased insulin sensitivity while only the alteration in the mrna levels of ppar gamma and resistin could be associated with insulin resistance in tfafed rats these findings suggest that dietary sfas and tfas alter the expression of different genes associated with insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue
sargis r m and p v subbaiah 2003 trans unsaturated fatty acids are less oxidizable than cis unsaturated fatty acids and protect endogenous lipids from oxidation in lipoproteins and lipid bilayers biochemistry 4239 1153311543
epidemiological data suggest that dietary trans unsaturated fatty acids increase the risk of heart disease however the underlying mechanisms are unclear in this study we investigated one possible mechanism namely their effect on ldl oxidation supplementation of ldl with 10 161 transcholesteryl ester ce inhibited the oxidation compared to that with 161 cisce total replacement of core lipids with 182 transtransce decreased the rate of ldl oxidation by 19 compared to replacement with 182 ciscisce when the surface phosphoglycerides were replaced with either 160182 ciscisphosphatidylcholine pc or 160182 transtranspc the latter was found to inhibit the rate and increase the lag time of oxidation to a greater extent than the former to confirm these findings we studied the oxidation of pc liposomes by assessing the formation of conjugated dienes or the degradation of a fluorescently labeled pc by both methods the 160182 transtranspc exhibited greater resistance to oxidation than the 160182 ciscispc eliminating the fluidity differences did not completely eliminate the differences in oxidation rates suggesting that the trans double bond is inherently resistant to oxidation the composition of the conjugated hydroperoxy products formed after oxidation differed markedly for the two 182 isomers supplementation of 160182 ciscispc liposomes with 20 mol  di161 transpc retarded oxidation rates to a greater extent than supplementation with di161 cispc these studies show that dietary trans unsaturated fatty acids decrease the rate of lipid peroxidation an effect that may mitigate the atherogenic effect of these fatty acids

phytosterols are a group of cyclic triterpenes frequently found in vegetable food especially in oils nuts and pulses where they are present at higher concentrations esterified phytosterols and stanols have been found to lower the cholesterol level they are added to special sorts of margarine intake of 23 g of phytosterol ester per day reduces total cholesterol by about 15  and ldl plasma levels by 1015  phytosterols and stanols inhibit the intestinal uptake of cholesterol by a competitive inhibition of cholesterol incorporation in micells systemic effects are discussed as well from the toxicological point of view the phytosterol and stanol quantities contained in margarine are considered to be harmless only a decrease of the plasma carotenoid concentration has been reported phytosterol and stanol enriched preparations may be recommended to those individuals with hypercholesterinemia in particular whose eating habits cannot be modified or be modified only insignificantly
background conjugated linoleic acids cla and principally c9t11 cla are suspected to have numerous preventive properties regarding noninfectious pathologies such as inflammatory diseases atherosclerosis and several types of cancer c9t11 cla is produced in the rumen during biohydrogenation of linoleic acid but can also be synthesized in mammalian tissues from transvaccenic acid c181 t11 through the action of delta9 desaturase d9d for several years it is also known that c9t11 cla can be synthesized from conjugated linolenic acids clna ie c9t11c13 clna and c9t11t13 clna this study aimed at investigating to which extent and by which route c9t11 cla can be produced from another isomer of cla the t11t13 cla that is structurally very similar to c9t11t13 clna in caco2 cells methodologyprincipal findings caco2 cells were incubated for 24 h with 20 mu moll of t11t13 cla in the absence or presence of sterculic oil used as an inhibitor of d9d caco2 cells were able to convert t11t13 cla into c9t11 cla and c9t11t13 clna was formed as an intermediate compound in the presence of sterculic oil the production of this intermediate was decreased by 46 and the formation of c9t11 cla was decreased by 26 no other metabolite was detected conclusionssignificance these results not only highlight the conversion of t11t13 cla into c9t11 cla but demonstrate also that this conversion involves first a desaturation step catalysed by d9d to produce c9t11t13 clna and then the action of another enzyme reducing the double bond on the delta 13 position

dyslipidemia in diabetes is characterized by low highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol high triglyceride levels and higher concentrations of atherogenic lipoprotein molecules various interventions are of importance in the nutritional therapy of dyslipidemia an increased intake of unsaturated fatty acids from vegetable oils at the expense of saturated fatty acids lowers lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol transfatty acids food sources fat spreads and foods with partially hydrogenated fat fried foods fatrich baked goods and sweets cause an even more detrimental lipoprotein profile compared to saturated fatty acids and their intake should be limited significant reductions of ldl cholesterol are also achievable by fiberrich foods and foods enriched with plant sterols and stanols a reduction of body weight an increase in physical activity and a limitation of alcohol consumption to moderate amounts are effective interventions to control triglyceride and hdl cholesterol levels triglycerides can also be reduced by supplementation with longchain omega 3 fatty acids fish oil higher proportions of dietary carbohydrates cause higher triglyceride levels therefore moderation of carbohydrates in favor of unsaturated fatty acids can be an effective dietary strategy and the major focus is to limit the consumption of foods and beverages with added saccharose or fructose

segall j j 1994 dietary lactose as a possible risk factor for ischemicheartdisease  review of epidemiology international journal of cardiology 463 197207
international data show stronger correlations of mortality from ischaemic heart disease with per capita supply of dairy products excluding fat than with dairy fat and of estimated lactose than with dairy fat or margarine and other processed fats positively and vegetable oils and fats fat of fish or wine negatively butter and cheese which have a low content of lactose show moderate and zero correlations respectively populations with low or intermediate prevalence of adult lactose absorbers have a lower supply of dairy products excluding butter and therefore of lactose and a lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease than populations with a high prevalence of absorbers specific national and ethnic data suggest that a diet low or relatively low in lactose in populations with low or relatively low prevalence of lactose absorbers is more consistently associated with protection against ischaemic heart disease than are high intakes of unsaturated fatty acids wine alcohol or dietary fibre in seven countries with a high consumption of dairy products six at least with a high prevalence of lactose absorbers trends in ischaemic heart disease mortality appear to have reflected changes in the supply of milk and therefore of lactose but not consistently of butter or inversely of unsaturated fatty acids the findings reviewed in this paper call for further investigation of the subject epidemiologically and biochemically
backgroundaim due to its high content of ldlraising saturated fatty acids sfa milk fat has been considered to be hypercholesterolaemic but it also contains fatty acids and other constituents which seem to have a hypocholesterolaemic effect milk fat was modified by feeding cows rapeseed cake resulting in a reduced content of sfa and an increased content of unsaturated fatty acids the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of modified milk fat modfat on serum cholesterol fractions triacylglycerides  tag and lipoprotein a  lp a compared with regular milk fat regfat and with soft margarine marg method fifteen women and 16 men were enrolled in the intervention study nine of the participants were hypercholesterolaemic nutrient intake parameters serum lipids and lp a were determined results the serum concentration of hdl cholesterol increased in the modfat period leading to a decreased ldlhdl ratio in this period the lowest lp a concentrations were measured at the end of the control phase and at the end of the modfat period a decreasing tendency of serum tag concentration was observed in the modfat period conclusion the fatmodified milk seems to have positive effects on the ldlhdl ratio and the lp a concentrations both of which have been established as risk factors for coronary heart disease copyright c 2005 s karger ag basel

trans fatty acids have several beneficial aspects for processed foods owing to their characteristic structures these very characteristic structures in turn have been suspected to be associated with the possibility that traits fatty acids affect the development of several health problems including coronary heart disease and fetal and infant neurodevelopment and growth and childhood allergies
the effects of zeroerucic acid rapeseed oil and rapeseed oilcontaining margarine on plasma fatty acid composition and serum cholesterol were studied in butter users n 43 compliance to the substitution was followed by fatty acid analysis of total plasma and plasma phospholipids the amount of substitute fats represented on average 21  of total fat and 8  of total energy intake changes in the relative fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids indicated further fatty acid metabolism and were closely related to the serum cholesterol level the reduction in saturated fatty acids led to a significant increase in the proportion of n3 and n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa with the rapeseed oil diet whereas the margarine caused a significant rise in n6 pufa only rhe increase in the proportions of the two pufa families occurred in accordance with their competitive order most completely with the rapeseed oil diet when butter was replaced by rapeseed oil lowdensitylipoproteincholesterol decreased by an average of 91  without a reduction in highdensitylipoproteincholesterol during margarine substitution the reduction was 52  on average of the plasma phospholipids alphalinolenic acid and the linoleicstearic acid ratio but not oleic acid were the components most significantly correlated with serum cholesterol levels or the decrease in these levels the results show that rapeseed oil can act primarily as a source of essential fatty acids rather than that of monoenes in the diet of butter users
the effects of zero erucic acid rapeseed oil and olive oil on plasma fatty acid composition and serum cholesterol were studied in margarine users n  46 the replacement of margarine on bread by these oils accounted on average for 16 of the total fat and 7 of the total energy intake fatty acid analysis of total plasma indicated a dosedependent rise in alphalinolenic alphalla and oleic acid oa levels during rapeseed and olive oil substitutions respectively rapeseed oil substitution increased the proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid 04units on average in plasma phospholipids a slight decrease in lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ldlc and an increase in highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol hdlc 45 p  001 led to a significantly higher hdlctotal cholesterol tc ratio 19units the results suggest a marked competitive effect for alphalla not only among plasma phospholipid fatty acids but also in the relationships with serum lipids since the changes in alphalla rather than in oa were associated with those in ldlc and the hdlctc ratio no competitive action of polyunsaturated acids comparable to rapeseed oil was found during olive oil substitution in contrast to the rapeseed oil diet the reduced proportion of linoleic acid la in plasma phospholipids was not restored this may be unfavorable if the habitual intake of la is low however the effects on ldlc levels were beneficial the concentration decreased by 59 p  001 correlating inversely with the increase in oa in addition the concentration of hdlc remained unchanged during olive oil substitution
trans fa tfa have at least one trans double bond and comprise several isomers and types including many of the cla eg c9t11182 cla some tfa may have adverse effects eg cardiovascular disease whereas some are thought to have beneficial effects eg anticarcinogenicity the presence of tfa in human tissues and fluids is related to dietary intake although this relationship is not completely understoodespecially in regard to serum lipid fractions this study was conducted as part of an investigation designed to test the influence of butter 13 low tfa margarine lt and regular margarine rm on milk fat content here we tested the secondary hypothesis that consumption of b lt and rm by lactating women would result in differential distribution of tfa and cla in major serum lipid classes breastfeeding women n  11 participated in this randomized latinsquare study consisting of five periods intervention 1 5 d washout i 7 d intervention ii 5 d washout ii 7 d and intervention iii 5 d extracted serum lipid was separated into cholesterol ester ce tag and phospholipid pl fractions and analyzed for total and isomeric tfa and cla concentrations data indicate that tag consistently contained the highest concentration of total t181 no interaction between treatment and fraction was found for any of the t181 isomers identified absolute concentration of each t181 isomer was greatest during the rm period regardless of fraction on a relative basis concentrations of t10181 and t12181 were most responsive to treatment in the ce fraction the concentration of c9t11182 cla was highest in the tag fraction and lowest in the pl fraction regardless of treatment in summary these results indicate i that there is a differential distribution of some isomeric tfa and cla among human serum lipid fractions and ii that dietary tfa intake influences absolute and relative concentrations of some of the isomers in selected fractions

shao f and d a ford 2013 differential regulation of abca1 and macrophage cholesterol efflux by elaidic and oleic acids lipids 488 757767
trans fatty acid consumption is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease this increased risk has been attributed to decreased levels of hdl cholesterol and increased levels of ldl cholesterol however the mechanism by which trans fatty acid modulates cholesterol transit remains poorly defined atpbinding cassette transporter a1 abca1mediated macrophage cholesterol efflux is the ratelimiting step initiating apolipoprotein ai lipidation in this study elaidic acid the most abundant trans fatty acid in partially hydrogenated vegetable oil was shown to stabilize macrophage abca1 protein levels in comparison to that of its cis fatty acid isomer oleic acid the mechanism responsible for the disparate effects of oleic and elaidic acid on abca1 levels was through accelerated abca1 protein degradation in cells treated with oleic acid in contrast no apparent differences were observed in abca1 mrna levels and only minor changes were observed in liver x receptorretinoic x receptor promoter activity in cells treated with elaidic and oleic acid efflux of both tracers and cholesterol mass revealed that elaidic acid slightly increased abca1mediated cholesterol efflux while oleic acid led to decreased abca1mediated efflux in conclusion these studies show that cis and trans structural differences in 18 carbon n9 monoenoic fatty acids variably impact cholesterol efflux through disparate effects on abca1 protein degradation

shapiro s 1997 do trans fatty acids increase the risk of coronary artery disease a critique of the epidemiologic evidence american journal of clinical nutrition 66 s1011s1017
on the basis of metabolic and epidemiologic data it has been claimed that trans fatty acid intake causes coronary artery disease cad with greater than or equal to 30 000 deathsy in the united states and a considerably greater number of nonfatal cases the metabolic evidence is still controversial the epidemiologic evidence is reviewed here in most studies the likelihood that cad caused margarine use rather than the reverse was not excluded uncontrolled confounding particularly confounding by indication was ubiquitous selection bias conditional on margarine use was common the projection of 30 000 deathsy is not justified if the metabolic evidence when fully evaluated is deemed to be suggestive then the question of whether trans fatty acids are indeed harmful to human populations will be resolved only by means of a randomized controlled trial

shrapnel b 2012 should trans fats be regulated nutrition  dietetics 694 256259
aim the aim of this paper is to critically assess recent calls for increased regulation to lower the level of trans fats in the australian diet methods key milestones in the elucidation of the effects on trans fats on health were identified and reviewed trends in intakes of trans fats in australia and factors affecting those trends were described and compared with those in denmark which has regulated to lower population intake of trans fats results the scientific evidence demonstrating adverse effects of trans fats on human health is consistent and strong australian health authorities were quick to identify the potential risk of trans fats and communicate it to health professionals and the food industry the response from the margarine industry resulted in large falls in the trans fat content of the australian diet in the mid1990s a second wave of trans fat reduction across many foods categories has occurred subsequently total intake of trans fats in australia is now low half the upper limit recommended by the world health organization and lower than the intake in denmark trans fats of industrial origin comprise just oneeighth of 1 of dietary energy these falls in trans fat intake mirror the large falls that occurred in denmark prior to regulation conclusions the case for increased regulation to lower intake of trans fats in australia cannot be sustained the trans fat issue stands as a good example of selfregulation through collaboration between australian health agencies the food industry and the government

in this study the intake of n6 and n3 pufa of preschool children in flanders belgium was evaluated and recommendations to address the very low intake of longchain pufa are presented food consumption data based on parentally reported 3 d dietary records obtained from october 2002 to february 2003 of 661 children 338 boys 323 girls between 25 and 65 years of age and the pufa concentrations obtained from various food composition databases were used the actual pufa intake levels were compared to belgian european and american recommendations only the intake of linoleic acid la fell within the recommended ranges margarine bread biscuits and chocolate products contributed most to la intake the intake of alphalinolenic acid lna was low compared to the recommendations and was obtained mostly from the consumption of margarines and fatty sauces this resulted in a high lalna ratio the intake of all longchain pufa was far below the recommended levels meat and meat products were the most important sources of arachidonic acid consumption of fish and other seafood was very low though these were the most important sources of longchain n3 pufa in conclusion flemish preschool children should consume more n3rich products in order to increase their lna intake and decrease their lalna ratio furthermore the replacement of meat products rich in sfa by poultry would increase the arachidonic acid intake as well fatty fish consumption needs to be increased as it is a rich source of longchain n3 pufa
background regular seafood consumption is recommended in dietary guidelines the aim of this study was to investigate the importance of seafood as a nutrient source in adolescents diet and the extent to which seafood consumption can increase the intake of omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin d methods consumption data recorded during seven consecutive days for 341 adolescents selected in ghent belgium were used to estimate the intake of vitamin d linoleic la alphalinolenic lna arachidonic aa eicosapentaenoic epa docosapentaenoic dpa and docosahexaenoic dha acid results the adolescents consumed on average 321 mu gday vitamin d 117 gday la and 14 gday lna the mean intakes of aa epa dpa and dha were 832 559 184 and 1114 mgday respectively the major source of vitamin d was fortified margarine fats and oils were the main sources for la and lna the intake of aa was mainly contributed by meat poultry and eggs fish and seafood contributed for 841 593 and 644 respectively for epa dpa and dha conclusion flemish adolescents would benefit from increased seafood consumption as this would lead to a higher intake of epa and dha as well as of vitamin d moreover replacement of foods rich in saturated fat sfa by seafood products can help to reduce sfa intake
objective the aims of this study were to investigate the consistency of use of plant stanol ester margarine and to characterise consistent and inconsistent users design a cohort of plant stanol ester margarine users was established based on 14 national surveys conducted by the national public health institute in finland between 1996 and 1999 a followup study questionnaire was developed and sent to 1294 users in 2000 setting subjects who reported using plant stanol ester margarine in both the original survey and the followup study were classified as consistent users and the rest as inconsistent users subjects the study population consisted of 1094 subjects aged 1887 years 590 men and 504 women results there were 357 33 consistent and 737 67 inconsistent users of plant stanol ester margarine in the study population consistent users were more likely to be men and to have a higher household income than inconsistent users both consistent and inconsistent users were predominantly middleaged persons with a healthy lifestyle and diet as well as a history of cardiovascular disease healthfulness was the main factor affecting bread spread choice among 94 of the consistent users and 59 of the inconsistent users conclusions the use of plant stanol ester margarine is more often inconsistent than consistent there is nevertheless a relatively large subgroup of longterm users of plant stanol ester margarine it is important to examine the health effects especially among these regular users
improved nutritional habits are a major target in the treatment of dyslipidemias and atherosclerosis prevention a number of newer approaches have been developed in the last few years leading to a better knowledge of nutrients as well as of novel functional foods supplements or nutraceuticals which may provide an alternative to lipidlowering drugs functional foods are fortified or enriched products with potential health benefits whereas nutraceuticals can be defined as diet supplements that deliver a presumed bioactive food component in a nonfood matrix specific areas of current interest are those of dietary proteins with specific effects on cholesterolemia also leading to the identification of absorbable peptides and changes in fat intake resulting in a larger consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids both approaches represent an improvement compared with the classical method based on a lowlipid intake relevant nutraceuticals include plant sterolsstanols for cholesterol reduction and polyphenols with an attractive capacity to reduce lipoprotein oxidation platelet aggregability and thromboxane formation in addition new soluble fibers fish oil and chinese redrice have provided significant lessons on the potential use of nutraceuticals in cardiovascular disease prevention longterm studies show that a 32 mgdl serum cholesterol difference can lead to an estimated 18 cardiovascular risk reduction
a food can be regarded as functional if it can demonstrate a beneficial efficacy on one or more target functions in the body in a convincing way beyond adequate nutritional qualities functional foods should either improve the state of health and wellbeing andor reduce the risk of disease functional foods that are marketed with claims of heart disease reduction focus primarily on the major risk factors ie cholesterol diabetes and hypertension some of the most innovative products are designed to be enriched with protective ingredients believed to reduce risk they may contain for example soluble fibre from oat and psyllium useful both for lowering cholesterol and blood pressure or fructans effective in diabetes phytosterols and stanols lower ldlcholesterol in a dosedependent manner soya protein is more hypocholesterolaemic in subjects with very high initial cholesterol and recent data indicate also favourable activities in the metabolic syndrome n3 fatty acids appear to exert significant hypotriacylglycerolaemic effects possibly partly responsible for their preventive activity dark chocolate is gaining much attention for its multifunctional activities useful both for the prevention of dyslipidaemia as well as hypertension finally consensus opinions about tea and coffee have not emerged yet and the benefits of vitamin e garlic fenugreek and policosanols in the management of dyslipidaemia and prevention of arterial disease are still controversial

expert groups and public health authorities recommend that transfatty acid tfa intakes from industrially produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oils phvos should be less than 1 of total energy intake the starting point for any regulatory or nonregulatory response to this recommendation is to assess the extent of the problem by determining where in the food supply tfas are found and the amounts consumed in the population unfortunately this is a particularly difficult task using traditional methods of dietary assessment inasmuch as food composition databases with tfa data are either nonexistent or incomplete in most countries current evidence on estimates of intake suggests there is high variability in tfa intakes and their food sources between countries the ubiquitous presence of phvos in the global food supply in bakery products deepfried foods snack foods confectionery products and table spreads attests to their commercial value and convenience however their common use is more the result of historical convenience from an industry infrastructure developed over 50 years based on efficient costeffective hydrogenation of vegetable oils rather than any inherent sensory or physical superiority of the hydrogenated fats over purposemade zerotrans fats and oils current global supply of appropriate zerotrans replacement fats high in cisunsaturated fatty acids is insufficient to meet the demand if all phvos in the food supply were replaced regulatory action needs to be coordinated with supply to maximize the opportunity for health gains by replacing partially hydrogenated fats with purposeready zerotrans vegetable oils low in saturates and high in cisunsaturates rather than animal fats and tropical oils high in saturated fatty acids european journal of clinical nutrition 2009 63 s34s49 doi101038sjejcn1602974

the contribution of the home use of margarines made with partially hydrogenated vegetables oils to total trans fatty acid intake is difficult to determine using dietary assessment because food composition databases are incomplete for trans fatty acids moreover hidden fats in manufactured foods may be the predominant sources of trans fatty acids the objective of our study was to determine using plasma phospholipid trans fatty acid composition as a surrogate measure of exposure whether the home use of margarine or butter is an important determinant of trans fatty acid status we conducted a communitybased dunedin new zealand crosssectional survey of people who consumed either margarine n 65 or butter n 64 but not both for home use the levels of the 18  1 trans isomers commonly found in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils were all significantly higher in the plasma phospholipids of margarine compared with butter consumers with the exception of 18  1n7t which did not differ among margarine consumers the percentage of total fat from margarine was significantly correlated with levels of phospholipid 18  1n6t 18  1n8t and 18  1n129t isomers r 0 center dot 570 center dot 63 p  0 center dot 001 but only weakly with 18  1n7t r 0 center dot 30 p0 center dot 016 the intake of fat from fast foods bakery products or meat and meat products was not associated with plasma phospholipid trans isomeric composition the home use of margarine made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils is an important determinant of trans fatty acid exposure in new zealand

the association between trapsfatty acids tfa and cancer risk is poorly understood and remains controversial it is recognised that unique biological effects are associated with specific isoforms within families of fatty acids such as those belonging to the n3 fatty acids furthermore the interactions between diet and genetic polymorphisms are increasingly recognised for their potential riskmodifying effects on human health and disease therefore the aim of the present review is to evaluate whether specific tfa isomers and genetic polymorphisms differentially modify cancer risk in prostate colon and breast cancers in animal and human models potential mechanisms of action by which tfa may affect cancer development are also reviewed overall across a number of experimental models and human studies there is insufficient and inconsistent evidence linking specific tfa isomers to cancers of the prostate colon and breast a number of methodological limitations and experimental considerations were identified which may explain the inconsistencies observed across these studies therefore further research is warranted to accurately assess the relationship between tfa and cancer risk

low aqueous solubility of lipophilic agents such as free fatty acids hampers proper in vitro demonstration of biological effects yielding an ambiguous in vitroin vivo correlation we have therefore developed a method for evaluating the acute effects of lipophilic substances on the shape of erythrocytes and estimated ec50 and hill coefficient according to the sigmoidal em model the test substance dissolved in mediumchain triglyceride is coated on a polycarbonate slide which serves as a cover sheet of a burker chamber freshly collected fingertip blood is diluted with autologous edtaplasma and introduced into the chamber after 10 min at 37 degrees c the cells are photographed under microscope and the fractions of normal and defect cells are evaluated no staining is needed and the cells are kept viable during the test period with increasing chain length fatty acids aliphatic amines and alcohols all increased the fraction of defect erythrocytes in a concentrationdependent manner the results indicate that several fatty acids are very potent in their acute actions on erythrocytes and that this effect is due to chain length rather than conformation conclusion the technique offers a screening method for testing the harmful effects of small amounts of lipophilic substances on erythrocytes c 2008 elsevier bv all rights reserved
trans fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids produced by the partial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated oils over the last few years an increasing interest on these fatty acids has been shown because of their role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases to date major scientific associations strongly recommend consuming a low intake of trans fatty acids for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases but data on the consumption of these fatty acids in the general population are still lacking we conducted this observational study on a population of italian teenagers in order to evaluate the consumption of trans fatty acids in the diet we studied 81 italian teenagers 45 males and 36 females with a median age of 16 years to assess their consumption of trans fatty acids we used the high school survey a questionnaire prepared by the harvard medical school total calories of the studied population were 23592  5915 kcalday with a mean intake of trans fatty acids of 324  148 gday corresponding to 123 of the total energy a relevant proportion of subjects namely 51 629 exceeded the limit contribution of 1 of energy from trans fatty acids their intake of total calories and trans fatty acids significantly increased according to their increasing age p  00003 for trend our data therefore obtained in a limited population of italian adolescents showed that a consistent proportion of adolescents does not follow the nutritional recommendations for intake of trans fatty acids likely increasing their risk of cardiovascular diseases
takeaway food is a significant contributor to dietary fat intake in australia the deepfryer is an important appliance in australian takeaway food outlets if deepfryer oils are not managed appropriately undesirable breakdown products accumulate when 23 used oil samples and paired unused control oil samples from takeaway food outlets in northeastern australia were analysed for fatty acid profile and indicators of deterioration oil identity and condition were found to differ greatly transfatty acid content was generally low although one unused oil sample contained 438 ww two oil samples had polar compound contents above 25 the highest being 287 peroxide values and acid values both singularly and in combination correlated poorly with polar compound levels these low correlation levels seemed unrelated to antioxidant levels in unused oil samples concentrations of bha and tbhq in unused oil samples varied from nil to 180 mgkg legal limit 200 mgkg improved deepfryer oil management in takeaway food outlets presents many opportunities to enhance the quality and safety of takeaway food

biohydrogenation of c18unsaturated fatty acids released from the hydrolysis of dietary lipids in the rumen in general occurs rapidly but the range of hydrogenation is quite large depending on the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids the configuration of unsaturated fatty acids microbial type and the experimental condition conjugated linoleic acid cla is incompletely hydrogenated products by rumen microorganisms in ruminant animals it has been shown to have numerous potential benefits for human health and the richest dietarv sources of cla are bovine milk and milk products the cis9 trans11 is the predominant cla isomer in bovine products and other isomers can be formed with double bonds in positions 810 1012 or 1113 the term cla refers to this whole group of 18 carbon conjugated fatty acids alphalinolenic acid goes through a similar biohydrogenation process producing trans11 c181 and c180 but may not appear to produce cla as an intermediate although the cla has been mostly derived from the dietary c182 alternative pathway may be existed due to the extreme microbial diversity in the reticulorumen regardless of the origin of cla manipulation of the biohydrogenation process remains the key to increasing cla in milk and beef by dietary means by increasing rumen production of cla although the effect of oil supplementation on changes in fatty acid composition in milk seems to be clear its effect on beef is still controversial thus further studies are required to enrich the cla in beef under various dietary and feeding conditions

background lactobacillus sp are probiotic microorganisms and some of them are able to produce conjugated linoleic acid cla via the biohydrogenation of linoleic acid la both cla and la are polyunsaturated fatty acids commonly used in the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease high cholesterol and cancer among other ailments the carbon source is one variable that can affect the growth and characteristics of these bacteria molecules called prebiotics are known to benefit human health by stimulating the growth and activity of probiotic bacteria present in the intestinal microflora the aim of this study was to evaluate how different oligosaccharides affect the growth and fatty acid profile of lactobacillus plantarum nrrl  b4496 l plantarum cultivation was performed in manrogosasharpe mrs medium and the original carbon source glucose in this medium was partially or totally replaced by an oligosaccharide isomaltooligosaccharide imo or gentiooligosaccharide gto then the biomass concentration and fatty acid profile were determined using spectrophotometry and gas chromatography respectively results when 50 of the glucose in the mrs medium was replaced with imo the maximum growth was 26 gl at 37 degrees c under the same culture conditions the incorporation of gto only produced 2 gl of biomass at 45 degrees c the growth of the bacterial culture was lower than that observed at 37 degrees c reaching only 04 gl when cultivated at 37 degrees c in a mixture of glucose and gto 1 1 cla 34 c9t11 was obtained from cells of l plantarum however when the cultivation was performed at 45 degrees c cla was not obtained when imo was used differences in cla content were not observed between l plantarum cultivated with glucose or with imo present however vaccenic acid was produced conclusions lactobacillus plantarum grow well when a mixture of imo and glucose is used as the carbon source however this mixture does not improve the cla content most likely due to high enzymatic activity that promotes the conversion of cla to vaccenic acid additionally gto is likely less readily metabolized by this strain thus the enzymatic activity is likely lower and less cla is converted to vaccenic acid resulting in an accumulation of cla
background the perception that all highfat snacks are unhealthy may be wrong objective we aimed to assess whether replacing lowfat and highfat snacks with snacks rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas and low in saturated and trans fatty acids would improve cardiovascular health design thirtythree adults participated in a randomized crossover trial of 3 controlled feeding phases of 25 d each in which a different type of snack was provided lowfat 308 of energy from fat 52 of energy from pufas highpufa 363 of energy from fat 97 of energy from pufas or highfat 379 of energy from fat 58 of energy from pufas snack results each diet reduced ldl and total cholesterol concentrations but reductions were greater with the lowfat and the highpufa diets than with the highfat diet ldl cholesterol 118 and 125 compared with 88 respectively p  003 and 001 total cholesterol 105 and 107 compared with 79 respectively p  003 and 002 the highpufa diet tended to reduce triacylglycerol concentrations 94 p  006 and this change was greater than that with the lowfat p  0028 and highfat p  00008 diets conclusions these data show that snack type affects cardiovascular health consuming snack chips rich in pufa and low in saturated or trans fatty acids instead of highsaturated fatty acid and trans fatty acid or lowfat snacks leads to improvements in lipid profiles concordant with reductions in cardiovascular disease risk

plant sterols have been known for several decades to cause reductions in plasma cholesterol concentrations these plant materials have been granted a conditional health claim in the united states regarding their effects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and are being sold in functional foods in several countries in europe as well as in the united states and australia it is generally suggested that daily consumption of similar to2 g of plant sterols can lower cholesterol concentrations as part of a dietary prevention strategy however phytosterols have been added and tested for their cholesterollowering effects mainly in spreads consumption of these highfat foods seemingly flies in the face of current recommendations for the promotion of heart health which suggest lowering total fat and energy intake to maintain weight hence new food formulations are being evaluated using phytosterols incorporated into lowfat and reducedfat food items the purpose of this review is to examine the cholesterollowering efficacy of plant sterols focusing on novel food applications their mechanism of action and safety these novel food formulations include new solubilization processes that lead to improved uses for plant sterols as well as new foods into which phytosterols have been incorporated such as breads cereals and beef such new foods and formulations should pave the way for greater use of phytosterols in heart health promotion increasing the longerterm potential for the creation of innovative functional foods containing plant sterols and their derivatives
dietary fatty acids are incorporated into atheromatous plaques mainly in the form of cholesterol esters physicochemical properties of the plaque eg mechanical strength depend on its fatty acid composition trans isomers of unsaturated fatty acids tfa are known to reduce the availability of fatty acid precursors for the synthesis of anticoagulant pg1 and pg3 prostaglandins the present study was undertaken to determine the content of trans isomers in atheromatous plaques and to search for correlations between trans isomers in the plaque and adipose tissue atheromatous plaques were obtained from 31 patients who underwent surgery due to atherosclerotic stenosis of the abdominal aorta iliac or femoral arteries fatty acids were extracted and separated as methyl esters using gas chromatography gc with an internal standard correlations were searched for with statistical methods taking the level of significance as p005 we found spatial and positional isomers of sixteen and eighteencarbon fatty acids in plaques and adipose tissue with elaidic acid c181 trans9 being the most abundant every plaque and adipose tissue sample contained linolelaidic acid c182 trans9 trans12 which is derived exclusively from linoleic acid as well as conjugated dienes of linoleic acid cla produced during oxidative processes the presence of trans isomers of fatty acids in the atheromatous plaque seems to be of relevance to plaque formation of much concern is the detection of elaidic and linolelaidic acids which adversely affect the physiologically important metabolism of eicosanoids the tfa pool in adipose tissue has little effect on the amount of these acids in the atheromatous plaque apparently the presence of tfa in atheromatous plaques is the result of processes taking place during plaque formation and maturation
objectives trans isomers of fatty acids tfa have been implicated in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis previous studies have shown that transunsaturated fatty acids like their cisunsaturated counterparts exert a modifying effect on platelet aggregation the aim of this work was to determine the influence of tfa on the aforementioned enzymes lipoxygenase and cycloxygenasethromboxane synthase methods two c18 cistrans fatty acid pairs oleicelaidic and linoleiclinolelaidic were chosen fasting blood was sampled from 30 healthy volunteers without any lipid abnormalities and not on medication for at least 7 days prior to sampling plateletrich plasma prp was prepared and the platelet count was adjusted to 3  108 cells  ml1 fatty acids in hexane were added to a final concentration of 7 mum and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen 500 mul of prp was pipetted into each tube thoroughly mixed and incubated at 37degreesc for 60 min 12p lox activity was measured with a spectrophotometric method and expressed per mg protein cycloxygenasethromboxane synthase activity was determined by txb2 production with an elisabased assay statistics were done with the kruskalwallis test and statistica software package results we have found that the activity of 12p lox was suppressed by all cistrans fatty acids used by us cycloxygenasethromboxane synthase activity was significantly inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids only linolelaidic acid was more potent in comparison to its monounsaturated elaidic acid counterpart conclusions we believe that the effects of fatty acids are demonstrated at the membrane level where fatty acids may produce a perturbation in specific lipid domains tfa are able to interact with the platelet membrane and transmembrane proteins just as the cis isomers by interacting with proteins exposed on the cytoplasmic membrane tfa may modify the activity of receptors and other membrane proteins in this way changes on the membrane surface are propagated into the cell affecting the activity of cytoplasmic enzymes like 12p lox and cycloxygenasethromboxane synthase c elsevier inc 2004
the aim of this study was to use lipidomics to determine if the lipid composition of apolipoproteinbcontaining lipoproteins is modified by dyslipidaemia in type 2 diabetes and if any of the identified changes potentially have biological relevance in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes vldl and ldl from normolipidaemic and dyslipidaemic type 2 diabetic women and controls were isolated and quantified with hplc and mass spectrometry a detailed molecular characterisation of vldl triacylglycerols tag was also performed using the novel ozoneinduced dissociation method which allowed us to distinguish vaccenic acid c181 n7 from oleic acid c181 n9 in specific tag species lipid class composition was very similar in vldl and ldl from normolipidaemic type 2 diabetic and control participants by contrast dyslipidaemia was associated with significant changes in both lipid classes eg increased diacylglycerols and lipid species eg increased c161 and c203 in phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester and increased c160 palmitic acid and vaccenic acid in tag levels of palmitic acid in vldl and ldl tag correlated with insulin resistance and vldl tag enriched in palmitic acid promoted increased secretion of proinflammatory mediators from human smooth muscle cells we showed that dyslipidaemia is associated with major changes in both lipid class and lipid species composition in vldl and ldl from women with type 2 diabetes in addition we identified specific molecular lipid species that both correlate with clinical variables and are proinflammatory our study thus shows the potential of advanced lipidomic methods to further understand the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes

the medical link between dietary saturated fat serum cholesterol and arteriosclerosis redefined meanings for butter in new zealand from a celebrated dietary staple to a potentially harmful substance to be closely monitored in the diet the introduction of a nutritionally endorsed butter substitute polyunsaturated margarine heightened this shift this article addresses the ways in which such links are taken up and negotiated outside the medical sphere it examines the responses of government nutritional organizations the dairy industry commercial interests women responsible for feeding coronary heart disease sufferers and everyday butter consumers the article concludes that rearticulating meanings for butter along medicalized lines was a highly fraught undertaking particularly in a country in which dairying was of central economic importance and underpinned national iconography
more than one quarter of total daily calories are normally provided by fatty acids which contain at least one double bond the usual configuration of these double bonds is the cis configuration trans fatty acids tfa are formed in technological and microbiological processes by isomerization of cis double bonds to trans double bonds in the 1990s there was public health concern about epidemiological studies suggesting that tfa increase the risk of coronary heart disease high intakes of tfa may have an influence on total cholesterol and other blood parameters but on the other hand there have been a lot of studies which have not been able to confirm these results tfa are formed in varying amounts during the industrial hydrogenation of vegetable oils and in the first stomach of ruminants regular margarines contain varying contents of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and therefore of tfa the main dietary tfa are the trans octadecenoic acids which contribute to approximately 8090  of total tfa content in foods the predominant isomer of milk fat is trans vaccenic acid which is directly influenced by ruminant feeding conditions for a reliable identification and quantification of tfa in foods and other biological matrices it is necessary to use a combination of chromatographic methods gcfid gcms gcftir aghplc

sudhop t and k von bergmann 2002 cholesterol absorption inhibitors for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia drugs 6216 23332347
the benefits of lipid lowering therapy on coronary heart disease have been clearly established in many clinical trials on primary and secondary prevention despite the availability of potent lipid lowering drugs many patients do not reach the current treatment goals this paper reviews new therapeutic approaches in lipid lowering drugs focusing on compounds which lower cholesterol absorption the role of plant sterols and stanols new acylcoa cholesterol oacyl transferase acat inhibitors microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mtp inhibitors and ezetimibe are summarised although the lipid lowering effect of plant sterols and plant stanols is only moderate their use as functional foods is beneficial for patients with mild hypercholesterolaemia and is able to enhance the lipid lowering effect of hmgcoa reductase inhibitors statins the role of acat inhibitors that might also inhibit cholesterol absorption remains unclear avasimibe the first oral bioavailable acat inhibitor has entered phase iii trials however the presently available data in humans do not indicate a clear clinical benefit the role of mtp inhibitors which exhibit remarkable effects on all plasma lipids also remains unclear as safety concerns must first be addressed ezetimibe the first available 2azetidinone succeeded in phase iii trials showing remarkable effects in inhibition of cholesterol absorption as well as cholesterol lowering the synergistic effect of coadministration of ezetimibe with statins seemingly offers a new approach in reaching the therapeutic goals
sudhop t and k von bergmann 2004 sitosterolemia  a rare disease zeitschrift fur kardiologie 9312 921
elevated plasma plant sterol concentrations xanthomatosis and accelerated often fatal  atherosclerosis at young age are the major findings in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia a defect in the abcg5 or abcg8 cotransporter gene locus stsl causes an increased intestinal absorption and a decreased biliary elimination of all sterols plant sterols as well as cholesterol leading to a 50 to 200fold increase in plasma plant sterol concentrations a few recent publications indicate that even moderately elevated plasma plant sterol levels might be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis this raises the question whether plant sterols themselves might be atherogenic or whether elevated plasma levels are a marker for a decreased abcg5g8 transporter activity which itself causes an increased risk for atherosclerosis however current data are too few to conclude that elevated plant sterol concentrations in plasma are an additional risk factor for coronary heart disease but especially young patients suffering from xanthomatosis andor atherosclerotic diseases with only mildly or moderately elevated plasma cholesterol should be screened for sitosterolemia by measurement of plasma plant sterol levels
the objective of this stud was to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with calcium salts of soybean oil fatty acids caso and linseed oil fatty acids calo on c9t11cla production in ruminal fluid and milk fat from holstein dairy cows rumen fermentation lactational performances and fatty acid profiles in ruminal fluid and milk fat were also investigated twenty multiparous holstein dairy cows were allotted randomly into two groups consisting of ten cows in each group according to calving date and average milk yield the first group of cows was fed a control without calcium salts diet and a treatment as 10 of caso on dm basis for 30 days in each period in the second group cows were fed the same control diet and 10 of calo as a treatment in the same manner the forage concentrate ratio was 5248 and diets were formulated to contain 17 crude protein dm basis for both groups ruminal ph protozoal numbers and the concentration of total volatile fatty acids were unchanged however the ruminal ammonian decreased by feeding caso or calo treatment compared to the control diet the vaccenic acid trans11c181 va in rumen fluid increased p  001 by 169 and 153 and the c9t11cla content of rumen fluid increased p  001 by 214 and 210 in the caso and calo treatments respectively compared to the control diet in milk fatty acids the va content increased by 130 and 132 in the evening and morning milking times respectively and the c9t11cla content increased by 125 in both milking times for the caso supplementation than that of control diet in the case of calo supplementation the va increased by 117 and 114 and the c9t11cla increased by 96 and 94 in the evening and morning milking times respectively compared to the control diet the contents of va and c9t11cla of milk fatty acids were numerically higher in the evening milking time compared to the morning milking time for control and both treatments finally these results indicated that the supplementation of caso or calo treatment increased the va and the c9t11cla in both ruminal fluid and milk fat of holstein dairy cows
background erythrocyte fatty acids may be superior to plasma fatty acids for reflecting longterm fatty acid intake because of less sensitivity to recent intake and a slower turnover rate objective the objective was to compare the fatty acid content of erythrocytes with that of plasma with respect to their abilities to reflect usual fatty acid intake design fatty acids in plasma and erythrocytes were measured by capillary gasliquid chromatography in 306 us women aged 4369 y fatty acid intake was assessed with a foodfrequency questionnaire which was validated for measuring intakes of various fatty acids results docosahexaenoic acid dha 226n3 in erythrocytes and plasma provided the strongest correlations with its intake but erythrocyte dha concentrations spearmans partial correlation coefficient rs  056 were better than plasma dha concentrations rs  048 as a biomarker total trans fatty acids rs  043 and total 181 trans isomers rs  042 in erythrocytes were also more strongly correlated with intake than were those in plasma rs  030 and rs  029 respectively moderate correlations were observed for linoleic acid 182n6 erythrocytes rs  024 plasma rs  025 alphalinolenic acid 183n3 erythrocytes rs  018 plasma rs  023 and eicosapentaenoic acid 205n3 erythrocytes rs  038 plasma rs  021 for polyunsaturated and trans fatty acids correlations between intakes and biomarkers improved moderately when average intakes over previous years were used conclusion erythrocyte n3 fatty acids of marine origin and trans fatty acid content are suitable biomarkers for longterm intake
background  high consumption of trans fat has been linked to the risk of coronary heart disease chd we assessed the hypothesis that higher trans fatty acid contents in erythrocytes were associated with an elevated risk of chd in a nested casecontrol study among us women methods and results  blood samples were collected from 32 826 participants of the nurses health study from 1989 to 1990 during 6 years of followup 166 incident cases of chd were ascertained and matched with 327 controls total trans fatty acid content in erythrocytes was significantly correlated with dietary intake of trans fat correlation coefficient  044 p  001 and was associated with increased plasma lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol p for trend  006 decreased plasma highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations p for trend  001 and increased plasma lowdensity lipoprotein to highdensity lipoprotein ratio p for trend  001 after adjustment for age smoking status and other dietary and lifestyle cardiovascular risk factors higher total trans fatty acid content in erythrocytes was associated with an elevated risk of chd the multivariable relative risks 95 confidence intervals of chd from the lowest to highest quartiles of total trans fatty acid content in erythrocytes were 10 reference 16 07 to 36 16 07 to 34 and 33 15 to 72 p for trend  001 the corresponding relative risks were 10 11 13 and 31 p for trend  001 for a total of 18 1 trans isomers and 10 15 25 and 28 p for trend  001 for a total of 18 2 trans isomers conclusions  these biomarker data provide further evidence that high trans fat consumption remains a significant risk factor for chd after adjustment for covariates
although dietary trans fatty acids can affect plasma lipoproteins negatively in humans no direct comparison with specific saturated fatty acids has been reported even though trans fatty acids were designed to replace saturates in foods and food processing in this study dietary trans 181 elaidic acid at 55 energy en was specifically exchanged for cis 181 160 or 120  140 in 27 male and female subjects consuming moderate fat 31 en low cholesterol 225 mgd whole food diets during 4wk diet periods in a crossover design the transrich fat significantly elevated total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol relative to the 160rich and 181rich fats and uniquely depressed hdl cholesterol relative to all of the fats tested trans fatty acids also elevated lipoprotein a lpa values relative to all dietary treatments furthermore identical effects on lipoproteins were elicited by 160 and cis 181 in these subjects the current results suggest that elaidic acid one of the principal trans isomers produced during industrial hydrogenation of edible oils adversely affects plasma lipoproteins thus the negative effect of elaidic acid on the lipoprotein profile of humans appears to be unmatched by any other natural fatty acids

background and aim dietary changes such as reducing the consumption of foods high in saturated fat and increasing the daily intake of unsaturated fat fibre and vitamins may have beneficial effects on longterm health accurate dietary information is essential for dietary counselling most of the methods used to examine an individuals diet food records diet interview food frequency questionnaires are too complicated and timeconsuming for routine clinical use there is a need for a fast and simple tool for food assessment the aim of this study was to evaluate a short and simple food questionnaire for use in clinical practice that emphasises the intakes of fat fibre fruit and vegetables representative of the usual diet of an individual or group methods and results a 15item questionnaire was completed twice on the same day by 111 participants in order to study reproducibility and its validity was checked by comparing the results with those of a 7day food record for 101 subjects the participants reported a positive attitude to the questionnaire the reproducibility and validity studies comparing the sum scores of the questionnaire and food record gave correlation coefficients of respectively 095 and 073 thus indicating good agreement the reproducibility study showed weighted kappa coefficients ranging from 097 for milk and snacks to 075 for vegetables in the validity assessment the weighted kappa coefficients ranged from 073 for butter and margarine to 014025 for vegetables fish and snacks which is a less satisfactory result the correlation coefficient between the sum score of the questionnaire and the percentage of dietary saturated fat was059 conclusions this simple selfadministered questionnaire allows for the rapid assessment of the constituents of the usual diet of an individual it provides a good estimate of dietary fat and fibre but is less accurate in terms of the intake of vegetables fish and snacks it also offers an opportunity to discuss central points in the improvement of dietary habits and may be a useful health educational tool in clinical practice c 2002 medikal press
background evidence from observational studies suggests that diets high in omega3 longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa may protect people from cognitive decline and dementia the strength of this potential protective effect has recently been tested in randomised controlled trials objectives to assess the effects of omega3 pufa supplementation for the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older people search methods we searched alois  the cochrane dementia and cognitive improvement groups specialized register on 6 april 2012 using the terms omega 3 pufa fatty acids fatty acid fish linseed eicosapentaenoic docosahexaenoic selection criteria randomised controlled trials of an omega3 pufa intervention which was provided for a minimum of six months to participants aged 60 years and over who were free from dementia or cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study two review authors independently assessed all trials data collection and analysis the review authors sought and extracted data on incident dementia cognitive function safety and adherence either from published reports or by contacting the investigators for original data data were extracted by two review authors we calculated mean difference md or standardised mean differences smd and 95 confidence intervals ci on an intentiontotreat basis and summarised narratively information on safety and adherence main results information on cognitive function at the start of a study was available on 4080 participants randomised in three trials cognitive function data were available on 3536 participants at final followup in two studies participants received gel capsules containing either omega3 pufa the intervention or olive or sunflower oil placebo for six or 24 months in one study participants received margarine spread for 40 months the margarine for the intervention group contained omega3 pufa two studies had cognitive health as their primary outcome one study of cardiovascular disease included cognitive health as an additional outcome none of the studies examined the effect of omega3 pufa on incident dementia in two studies involving 3221 participants there was no difference between the omega3 and placebo group in minimental state examination score at final followup following 24 or 40 months of intervention md 007 95 ci 025 to 010 in two studies involving 1043 participants other tests of cognitive function such as word learning digit span and verbal fluency showed no beneficial effect of omega3 pufa supplementation participants in both the intervention and control groups experienced either small or no cognitive declines during the studies the main reported sideeffect of omega3 pufa supplementation was mild gastrointestinal problems overall minor adverse events were reported by fewer than 15 of participants and reports were balanced between intervention groups adherence to the intervention was on average over 90 among people who completed the trials all three studies included in this review are of high methodological quality authors conclusions direct evidence on the effect of omega3 pufa on incident dementia is lacking the available trials showed no benefit of omega3 pufa supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy older people omega3 pufa supplementation is generally well tolerated with the most commonly reported sideeffect being mild gastrointestinal problems further studies of longer duration are required longerterm studies may identify greater change in cognitive function in study participants which may enhance the ability to detect the possible effects of omega3 pufa supplementation in preventing cognitive decline in older people
background and aims dietary therapy using phytosterols can reinforce statin treatment however the value of a lowdose combination of those agents remains to be investigated plant sterols ps dissolved in diacylglycerol dag oil psdag can be effective at a relatively low dose the objective of the present study was to examine the effect of psdag oil on blood cholesterol concentrations in hypercholesterolemic outpatients on lowdose pravastatin 10 mgday methods and results the patients n  61 were randomly assigned to one of three groups who consumed tag control dag or psdag oil the average intake of ps from the psdag oil during the test period was significantly higher than that for tag and dag oils 502 vs 49 and 38 mgday p  005 significant cholesterollowering effects from the baseline were observed in the case of the psdag oil treatment alone changes in lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol were inversely correlated with baseline serum campesterol concentrations r  0560 p  005 but not baseline ldl cholesterol concentrations in addition serum apolipoprotein b concentrations were reduced to a greater extent in subjects with high versus low levels of baseline campesterol 132 mgdl vs 31 mgdl p  005 furthermore there was a mild but significant reduction in serum lipoprotein a concentration from the baseline 59 mgdl which was correlated with the reduction in serum apolipoprotein b concentration r  0 596 p  005 conclusion a lowdose combination of psdag oil and pravastatin may be a useful strategy for further ameliorating blood cholesterol and lipoprotein a concentrations for hypercholesterotemic patients with a low response to pravastatin c 2007 elsevier bv all rights reserved
there are very limited data concerning the influence of lowlevel trans fatty acid tfa intake on blood lipid levels in this study correlation of total and diene tfa intake with serum cholesterol levels was studied in young japanese women the mean intakes of total and diene tfas were 036 and 005 of energy respectively there was a significant correlation between total fat intake and tfa intake tfa intake was significantly correlated with erythrocyte tfa content total tfa intake was not correlated with total ldl or hdlcholesterol levels no correlatuon was found between diene tfa intake and cholesterol level total and diene tfa intake were not correlated with hemoglobin a1c or creactive protein levels these results suggest that the average tfa intake of young japanese women does not adversely affect serum cholesterol levels
the world health organization who has recommended that trans fatty acid tfa intake should be less than 1 of total energy intake but few data are available as to the influence of energy tfa intake of as low as 1 on blood cholesterol levels a randomized doubleblind parallel trial was conducted to assess the effects of 1 tfa dietary supplementation on serum cholesterol levels in healthy young women sixtyfive volunteers consumed cookies containing 1 tfa or 004 control energy of tfa for 4 weeks and blood was harvested after overnight fasting there were no significant differences in serum ldl or hdlcholesterol levels between the two groups the hemoglobin a1c level was not influenced by dietary tfa these results suggest that energy of tfas at less than 1 has little effect on serum cholesterol or hemoglobin a1c levels in healthy young women this confirms the correctness of the who recommendation
background plant sterols and stanols are plant steroids with a similar chemical structure and cellular function to human cholesterol and are recommended as dietary modifiers of serum lipids plant sterols have a higher degree of absorption than plant stanols suggesting differential efficacy between the two design a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to summarize direct comparisons between the effect of plant sterols vs plant stanols on serum lipid levels in healthy patients and patients with hypercholesterolemia methods a systematic literature search of medline embase cochrane central and the natural medicines comprehensive database was conducted from january 1950 through january 2009 trials were included in the analysis if they were randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of plant sterols vs plant stanols in healthy patients or patients with hypercholesterolemia who reported efficacy data on total lowdensity lipoprotein and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterols or triglycerides the weighted mean difference wmd of the change from baseline in mgdl with 95 confidence interval was calculated as the difference between the means in the plant sterol and plant stanol groups using a randomeffects model results fourteen studies n531 patients met the inclusion criteria upon metaanalysis the results showed that there is no statistically or clinically significant difference between plant sterols and plant stanols in their abilities to modify total cholesterol wmd 111 mgdl 00286 mmoll 95 confidence interval ci 412 to 190 p047 lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol wmd 035 mgdl 00091 mmoll 95 ci 298 to 228 p079 highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol wmd 028 mgdl 000073 mmoll 95 ci 118 to 062 p054 or triglycerides wmd 180 mgdl 00203 mmoll 95 ci 680 to 321 p048 conclusions plant sterols and plant stanols do not have statistically or clinically relevant differing effects on total cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol or triglyceride levels the selection of plant sterols vs plant stanols should then be based on potential differences in safety parameters and further study is required to elucidate such differences j am diet assoc 2010110719726
african americans in the southern united states have a high prevalence of chronic disease tocopherol intake and status have been associated with protection against several chronic diseases our objectives were therefore to examine the association between tocopherol intakes as measured by 2 regional ffq and their corresponding concentrations in serum and to report on dietary sources of tocopherols in 404 men and women participating in the crosssectional diet and physical activity substudy of the jackson heart study a large proportion 49 of men and 66 of women reported dietary supplement use only 58 of men and 45 of women met the estimated average requirement ear for vitamin e from foods alone whereas 442 men and 492 women met it from foods and supplements total diet  supplement intake of atocopherol was associated with its corresponding measure in serum vitamin e supplement use sex serum cholesterol education and bmi but not gammatocopherol intakes were associated with serum gammatocopherol for deltatocopherol associated variables included sex and serum cholesterol the top food sources of alpha and gammatocopherol were snack chips and the top food source of deltatocopherol was margarine despite prevalent vitamin e supplement use more than onehalf of this population did not meet the ear for atocopherol intake and very few met it from food alone supplement use was associated with higher alpha but lower gammatocopherol concentration in serum the possible health implications of this difference in relative tocopherol subtypes require further study
objective to investigate cholesterollowering efficacy and safety of plant stanol ester margarine in healthy 6yearold children already consuming a lowsaturatedfat lowcholesterol diet study design eightyone intervention children from the strip project a randomized prospective trial aimed at reducing exposure of young children to the known environmental atherosclerosis risk factors were recruited to this doubleblind crossover study at 6 years of age in randomized order the families were advised to replace daily 20 g of the childs dietary fat intake with plant stanol ester margarine or control margarine for 3 months the washout period lasted 6 weeks statistical analysis was performed according to intentiontotreat principle with analysis of variance for crossover design results the mean daily plant stanol ester margarine consumption was 182 g 15 g plant stanol the welltolerated plant stanol ester margarine reduced serum total and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations ly 54 and 75 respectively p  0001 for loth the serum highdensitylipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and alphatocophertol to lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ratio remained unchanged the serum betacarotene to lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ratio decreased by 19 p 003 conclusion plant stanol ester margarine significantly diminishes serum total and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentration without adverse clinical effects in healthy children who already consume a lowsaturatedfat lowcholesterol diet but decreases the serum betacarotene to lowdensty lipoprotein cholesterol ratio
aim to evaluate the effects of gender apolipoprotein e phenotype and cholesterol absorption and synthesis estimated as serum plant sterol and cholesterol precursor sterol concentrations on the cholesterollowering effect of plant stanol esters in children methods eightyone healthy normocholesterolaemic 6yold children 45 boys were recruited from the special turku coronary risk factor intervention project strip a randomized prospective trial aiming at atherosclerosis prevention in childhood this placebocontrolled doubleblind crossover study comprised two 3mo study periods and a 6wk washout period during the study periods 20 g of the childrens daily dietary fat intake was replaced with plant stanol ester margarine or control margarine results in boys plant stanol esters reduced serum total and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations by 6 009 to 042 mmoll and 9 009 to 036 mmoll respectively p  001 for both in girls the decreases in concentrations were 4 003 to 038 mmoll and 6 002 to 032 mmoll p  005 for both the response rate did not differ between the genders serum total and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decreased by 6 and 8 p  001 for both respectively in both children with the apolipoprotein e 34 or 44 apoe4 phenotype and the apolipoprotein e 23 or 33 apoe4 phenotype cholesterol absorption decreased both in the apoe4 children and in the apoe4 children but cholesterol synthesis consistently increased in the apoe4 children only conclusion plant stanol esters reduce serum cholesterol concentration in healthy children irrespective of their gender or apoe4 phenotype
plant sterol supplementation reduces serum cholesterol concentration but may increase serum plant sterol concentrations especially in children we determined whether natural dietary plant sterols derived mainly from vegetable oil or margarine in early childhood affect serum concentrations of plant sterols campesterol and sitosterol and cholesterol precursor sterols delta 8 cholestenol desmosterol and lathosterol reflecting endogenous cholesterol synthesis we measured the serum sterol concentrations using gas liquid chromatography in 20 healthy 13moold intervention children in a randomized prospective study designed to decrease exposure of the children to known environmental atherosclerosis risk factors and in 20 control children the diet of the intervention children was rich in plant sterols due to replacement of milk fat with vegetable fat whereas the diet of the control children contained only small amounts of plant sterols the intervention children consumed twice as much plant sterols as the control children p  0001 their serum concentrations of campesterol and sitosterol were 75 and 44 higher respectively than those in the control children p  0001 for both but serum cholesterol precursor sterol concentrations did not differ between the two groups we conclude that doubling dietary plant sterol intake almost doubles serum plant sterol concentrations in 13moold children but has no effect on endogenous cholesterol synthesis relative intestinal absorption of natural plant sterols from the diet in early childhood is similar to that in adults
strokeprone spontaneously hypertensive rats shrsp are utilized as models for study of the pathogenesis of not only stroke and cardiovascular disorders but also atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome basic information on the profiles of fatty acids and lipid classes in the liver is indispensable to use shrsp as a model of disorder of lipid metabolism nevertheless detailed information on the metabolism of triacylglycerols tags and fatty acids in the liver of shrsp is lacking this study aimed to characterize profiles of lipid classes and fatty acids and to explore the mechanism underlying the characteristic alterations in metabolism of tags and fatty acids in the liver of shrsp in comparison with spontaneously hypertensive rats shr the characteristic changes observed in shrsp were 1 markedly lower hepatic tag contents 2 altered expressions of genes encoding three enzymes responsible for the control of tag level namely adipose triglyceride lipase for tag degradation upregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase la for fatty acid betaoxidation upregulated and longchain acylcoa synthetase 3 for glycerolipid synthesis downregulated 3 evidently lower contents and proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids in particular cisvaccenic acid 181n7 in the liver and serum and 4 downregulation of palmitoleoylcoa chain elongase which is necessary for the biosynthesis of 181n7 in the liver from the above observations we concluded that there are significant differences in profiles of lipid classes and fatty acids between shrsp and shr and that altered characteristics in shrsp are likely responsible for increases in tag hydrolysis and betaoxidation and decreases in tag synthesis and 181n7 synthesis
coronary heart disease is a major health problem in developed countries many studies have shown that elevated serum concentrations of total or lowdensitylipoprotein cholesterol ldl cholesterol are high risk factors whereas high concentrations of highdensitylipoprotein cholesterol hdl cholesterol or a low ldl to hdl cholesterol ratio may protect against coronary heart disease plant sterols and stanols derived from vegetable oils or wood pulp have been shown to lower total and ldl cholesterol levels in humans by inhibiting cholesterol absorption from the intestine these findings may lead to new therapeutic options to treat hypercholesterolemia in addition phytosterols may influence cell growth and apoptosis of tumor cells however they can interfere with the absorption of fat soluble vitamins and carotenoids c 2003 editions scientifiques et medicales elsevier sas all rights reserved

the paper is focused on the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa in the prevention of atherosclerosis and its complications the description of pufa chemical structure their position in the lipid subclass of fatty acids and their main dietary sources is presented the data from numerous studies confirm the beneficial role of pufa in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and its complications the strategies to increase pufa intake are outlined
the various positional isomers of oleic acid 18  1 delta 9c or 9c18  1 may have distinct biological effects detrimental effects of consumption of industrial transfatty acids tfa elaidic acid 18  1 delta 9t from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils on cvd risk factors are well documented in addition epidemiological data suggest that chronic consumption of industrial sources of tfa could alter insulin sensitivity and predispose for type 2 diabetes however intervention studies on this issue have remained inconclusive moreover very little information is available on the effect of natural sources of tfa vaccenic acid 18  1 delta 11t coming from dairy products and ruminant meat on the development of cvd and type 2 diabetes the review focuses on the impact of the consumption of ruminant tfa in relation to cardiovascular risk factors inflammation and type 2 diabetes
the us food and drug administrations final ruling on transfatty acid labeling issued in 2003 has caused a rapid transformation in the fat and oil industries novel ingredients and improved technologies are emerging to replace partially hydrogenated fats in foods we present an overview of the structure and formation of trans fatty acids in foods and a comprehensive review of the newly formulated products and current procedures practiced by the edible oil industry to reduce or eliminate trans fatty acids in response to the food and drug administrations regulations mandating trans fat labeling of foods
some kinds of vegetable oil and a partiallyhydrogenated oil shorten the survival of the strokeprone spontaneously hypertensive shrsp rats compared with perilla seed oil soybean oil and lard the n3n6 ratio of constituent fatty acids phytosterol content and other factors in these oils have been proposed to affect the survival of this strain here we examined the safety of a fat produced by the interesterification of perilla oil and lard perillalard on the bases of the survival of shrsp rats the mean survival time decreased in the order of the butter the perillalard the lard the margarine and the partiallyhydrogenated soybean oil hydsoy group the correlations between survival time and cholesterol content or phytosterol content in the diet were analyzed and the probable health benefits of the new margarinetype fats made of animal fats and oils with high n3n6 ratios were discussed
objectives since a relation between transfatty acids and cardiovascular diseases has been described we examined the relationship between margarine intake and nonfatal acute myocardial infarction ami in italian women design hospitalbased casecontrol study setting northern italy between 1983 and 1992 subjects cases were 429 women aged 1874 y in hospital with diagnosis of ami and 866 controls in hospital for acute noncardiovascular nonneoplastic nondigestive nonhormonerelated conditions analysis odds ratios or with their 95 confidence intervals ci were computed by unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis including terms for age education body mass index smoking alcohol and coffee drinking menopausal status hormone replacement therapy and history of diabetes hypertension and hyperlipidemia results medium or high intake of margarine was associated with an increased risk of ami multivariate or 15 95 ci 1022 analysis in separate strata of covariates indicated that the association was independent of body mass index history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and was greater in older women and in current smokers conclusions if real the association with margarine could explain about 6 of ami in this population of italian women
several studies have reported an association between consumption of trans fatty acids and risk of cardiovascular disease cvd these fatty acids enter the human diet most commonly as byproducts of hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats the amount of trans fats in foods exhibit great variation due to differences in hydrogenation methods and intensity in order to quantify the level of trans fats available in widely consumed commercial food items in argentina we measured total fat saturated fat and the trans fatty acid elaidic acid in 46 food items as an example from most common items total fat was 2034 in sliced bread 2925 in cookies and crackers 5080 in margarines 85 in butter and 3439 in snack products in the same items content of the trans fatty acid elaidic acid was 235277 in sliced bread 2852595 in cookies and crackers 18153184 in margarines 463 in butter and 01058 in snacks in order to compare the results on the fattyacid composition by using different analysis methods the same food items mentioned were analyzed in a column of lower polarity and shorter length and we found trans fatty acids were masked by cis unsaturated fatty acids a comparison with available data from similar products from other parts of the world indicates that argentinian products in the categories studied have higher content of trans fatty acids c 2000 elsevier science ltd all rights reserved
consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids tfa remains high in many populations particularly in developing nations where partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are frequently used for home cooking and among individuals in developed countries having high intakes of bakery or processed foods wellcontrolled observational studies and randomized trials indicate that tfa consumption adversely affects multiple risk factors for chronic diseases including numerous blood lipids and lipoproteins systemic inflammation endothelial dysfunction and possibly insulin resistance diabetes and adiposity growing evidence for the latter effects is particularly concerning given the worldwide obesity pandemic and high contents of industrially produced tfa in many foods marketed toward children consistent evidence from prospective observational studies of habitual tfa consumption and retrospective observational studies using tfa biomarkers indicates that tfa consumption increases risk of clinical coronary heart disease chd based on the adverse effects of risk factors and consistent relationships with clinical endpoints the evidence that tfa consumption increases chd risk is convincing some evidence suggests that tfa consumption may also increase other disease outcomes but further investigation is needed to confirm the presence and magnitude of such effects more research is also needed to understand how specific tfa isomers of varying chain length and double bond location may affect different biologic pathways of disease both individual and policylevel initiatives to decrease tfa consumption should continue particularly in population subgroups and in developing nations with high consumption of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils
temple n j 1996 dietary fats and coronary heart disease biomedicine  pharmacotherapy 5067 261268
the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease chd necessitates vigorous dietary intervention so as to lower the serum cholesterol level by at least 6 greater decreases in serum cholesterol can bring about reversal of atherosclerosis the critical dietary change is the reduction in intake of saturated fat and cholesterol some of this fat may be replaced by unsaturated fats especially monounsaturated fat olive or canola oil fish and the omega3 fats they contain may also be useful for the prevention of chd the benefits of omega3 fats occur within a few months and probably involve an antithrombotic effect there is evidence that the intake of transfatty acids formed by the hydrogenation of oils should be reduced as they are associated with chd hypolipidaemic drugs may be useful for persons at very high risk of chd but should generally be avoided for primary prevention
knowledge about the effects of dietary fats on subclinical inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk are mainly derived from studies conducted in western populations little information is available on south east asian countries this current study investigated the chronic effects on serum inflammatory markers lipids and lipoproteins of three vegetable oils healthy normolipidemic subjects n  41 33 females 8 males completed a randomized singleblind crossover study the subjects consumed high oleic palm olein hopo diet 15 of energy 181n9 9 of energy 160 partially hydrogenated soybean oil phso diet 7 of energy 181n9 10 of energy 181 trans and an unhydrogenated palm stearin pst diet 11 of energy 181n9 14 of energy 160 each dietary period lasted 5 weeks with a 7 days washout period the phso diet significantly increased serum concentrations of high sensitivity creactive protein compared to hopo and pst diets by 26 23 respectively p  005 for both and significantly decreased interleukin8 il8 compared to pst diet by 12 p  005 in particular phso diet and also pst diet significantly increased totalhdl cholesterol ratio compared to hopo diet by 23 13 respectively p  005 with the pst diet having a lesser effect than the phso diet by 8 p  005 the use of vegetable oils in their natural state might be preferred over one that undergoes the process of hydrogenation in modulating blood lipids and inflammation
evidence is accumulating that high serum concentrations of triacylglycerols tag are like ldl cholesterol causally related to cardiovascular disease a recent metaanalysis has indicated that plant stanol ester pse intake not only lowered ldl cholesterol but also serum tag concentrations especially in subjects with high baseline tag concentrations we therefore evaluated the effects of pse supplementation on lipid metabolism in a population with elevated fasting tag concentrations in a randomized placebocontrolled parallel study 28 subjects with elevated tag concentrations  17 mmoll were studied after a 1week runin period during which a control margarine was used subjects consumed for 3 weeks either control or pseenriched margarine 25 gday of plant stanols serum plant stanol concentrations increased in all subjects receiving the pseenriched margarines demonstrating good compliance pse supplementation significantly decreased serum total 67 p  0015 and ldl cholesterol 95 p  0041 a significant interaction between baseline tag concentrations and pse intake was found pse intake lowered tag concentrations particularly in subjects with high baseline tag concentrations  23 mmoll p  0009 additionally a significant interaction between baseline total number of ldl particles ldlp and pse intake was found p  0020 pse consumption lowered ldlp primarily in subjects with elevated baseline values this was mainly due to a nonsignificant decrease in the number of atherogenic small ldlp circulating levels of hscrp glucose and insulin were not changed after pse intake taken together pse supplementation not only lowered ldl cholesterol but also serum tag concentrations especially in subjects with overt hypertriglyceridemia
background evidence suggests that ruminant trans fatty acids fas such as vaccenic acid do not increase the risk of ischemic heart disease ihd however the effects of ruminant trans fas on risk markers of ihd have been poorly investigated objective the objective was to investigate the effect of butter with a naturally high content of vaccenic acid and a concomitantly higher content of monounsaturated fas on classic and novel risk markers of ihd design in a doubleblind randomized 5wk parallel intervention study 42 healthy young men were given 115 g fatd from test butter that was high in vaccenic acid 36 g vaccenic acidd or a control butter with a low content of vaccenic acid blood and urine samples were collected before and after the intervention results the intake of the vaccenic acidrich diet resulted in 6 and 9 lower total cholesterol and plasma hdlcholesterol concentrations respectively than did the intake of the control diet p  005 and 0002 respectively whereas the ratio of total to hdl cholesterol did not differ significantly between the groups the fa composition of lipid classes reflected the fas proportion of the test butter no other differences were observed conclusions butter high in ruminant trans and monounsaturated fas resulted in significantly lower total and hdl cholesterol than did the control butter with higher amounts of saturated fas it may be that the differences were due to the greater content of monounsaturated fas and the lesser content of saturated fas in the butter rich in ruminant trans fas rather than to the content of vaccenic acid per se

lipoproteina lpa is considered a risk factor for coronary heart disease our aim was to investigate the effect of individual fatty acids on postprandial plasma lpa and its association with lipemia and tissue plasminogen activator tpa five test fats dominated by approximately 43 gkg stearic s palmitic p oleic c181 trans m or linoleic acid were produced by interesterification sixteen young healthy men were served the individual test fats incorporated into meals 1 g fatkg body wt after a 12h fast in random order on different days separated by 3wk washout periods blood samples were drawn before and 2 4 6 and 8 h after eating there was a pronounced increase in lpa concentrations after intake of the test meals and the test fats resulted in a difference in lpa response p  0001 diet x time interaction however t fat did not change lpa during the time course studied t fat resulted in less area under the plasma lpa concentration curve compared to s and p fat p less than or equal to 0003 test fat with saturated fatty acids resulted in the highest lpa and lowest plasma triacylglycerol tag response with the reversed situation for t fat there was no association between lpa and tpa in conclusion intake of meals high in individual dietary fatty acids increased postprandial plasma lpa differently there seems to be a complex regulatory role of plasma tag on nonfasting plasma lpa concentrations
background there is increasing evidence that postprandial triacylglycerolrich lipoproteins may be related to atherogenic risk objective the objective was to investigate the effect of individual fatty acid intakes on postprandial plasma lipoprotein triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations plasma fatty acids and preheparin lipoprotein lipase and cholesterol ester transfer protein cetp activities design six test fats high approximate to 43 by wt in stearic acid palmitic acid palmitic  myristic acid oleic acid elaidic acid trans 181 and linoleic acid were produced by interesterification after having fasted for 12 h 16 healthy young men were served the individual test fats incorporated into meals 1 g fatkg body wt in random order on different days separated by washout periods blood samples were drawn before and 2 4 6 and 8 h after the meals results different responses to the testfat meals were observed for plasma lipoprotein triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations plasma fatty acid concentrations and lipoprotein lipase and cetp activities diet x time interaction 0001  p  005 intake of the longchain saturated fatty acids stearic and palmitic acids resulted in a relatively lower lipemic response than did intake of the unsaturated fatty acids probably because the saturated fatty acids were absorbed less and at a lower rate therefore the lipemic response took longer to return to postabsorptive values conclusions fatty acid chain length and degree of saturation appear to affect the extent and duration of lipemia and affect hepatic output indirectly these effects may not be mediated via effects on lipoprotein lipase and cetp activities
fatty acid profile of milk fat can be modified by cow feeding strategies our aim was postprandially and after 4 wk to compare the effect of a modified milk fat m diet with 16 of the cholesterolemic saturated fatty acid c1216 replaced by mainly oleic and stearic acids with the effect of d diet including a conventional danish milk fat on plasma lipids and lipoproteins a side effect of the cow feeding regime was a 5 ww increase in trans fatty acid in m diet eighteen subjects were fed for two periods of 4 wk strictly controlled isoenergetic test diets with 40 of energy from total fat and the same content of dietary cholesterol in a randomized study with crossover design contrary to expectations fasting low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol concentration did not differ after the experimental periods however m diet resulted in a higher fasting total triacylglycerol concentration compared to d diet p  0009 postprandial samples were taken at two different occasions i at day 21 after breakfast and lunch and ii on the last day of the study 2 4 6 and 8 h after a fat load postprandial plasma triacylglycerol and chylomicron triacylglycerol showed higher peak values after d diet than m diet interaction effect diet x times p  005 in conclusion m diet did not lower ldl cholesterol compared to d diet thus any cholesterollowering effect of oleic and stearic acids may have been obscured by the high content of cholesterolraising saturated fatty acids in mi ik fat a higher content of the trans fatty acids in m diet might have counteracted the cholesterol neutraldecreasing effect and increased plasma triacylglycerol
thomas l h 1992 ischemicheartdisease and consumption of hydrogenated marine oils in england and wales journal of epidemiology and community health 461 7882
study objective  the aim was to examine the hypothesis that hydrogenated fats particularly those obtained from marine oils may present a health hazard design  storage fat specimens obtained at necropsy were collected from several areas in england and wales during 19751978 cases n  136 samples consisted of males dying of ischaemic heart disease male deaths from unrelated causes acting as controls n  95 samples the fatty acid compositions of the specimens were determined and analysis included those acids161 trans and higher c20 plus c22 hhighly characteristic of partially hydrogenated marine oils measurements and main results  the case samples which had been shown to be the richer in 161 trans p  0005 were now found to have a significantly higher value of the ratio 161 trans to h p  0002 arising from consumption of differing hydrogenated marine oil types conclusions  it is concluded that the cases had consumed a greater amount p  0001 of hydrogenated marine oils of a certain type ie that manufactured from certain highly unsaturated raw oils the process of partial hydrogenation results in conversion to a product containing large amounts of polyunsaturated acids pufa which are no longer in the natural allcis methylene interrupted configuration such isomeric pufa may obstruct or compete with utilisation of natural pufa it is further concluded that the case excess did not rise from medical advice favouring margarine or from any difference in social class status but rather from fortuitous selection of margarine brand

thompson d h and d m warburton 1992 lifestyle differences between smokers exsmokers and nonsmokers and implications for their health psychology  health 74 311321
much evidence has been published in order to demonstrate that smoking cessation leads to a decrease in morbidity and mortality using data from the health and lifestyle survey respondents were divided into three groups smokers exsmokers and nonsmokers and lifestyle characteristics such as diet and exercise were compared smokers were more likely to eat chips french fries fried food butter and less likely to eat fresh fruit in winter green vegetables and margarine high in polyunsaturated fats nonsmokers were more likely than smokers and exsmokers to take part in keepfit jogging and swimming nonsmokers in smoking households were more likely than nonsmokers in nonsmoking households to eat fried food chips and butter and less likely to eat fruit in winter or margarine high in polyunsaturated fats results suggest that part of the assumed health benefits of smoking cessation are due to exsmokers having a healthier diet than that of smokers
a population sample of 375 men and women cigarette smokers were recruited to take part in a prospective study of smoking cessation to test the hypothesis that stopping smoking is associated with an increased consumption of the essential fatty acid linoleic acid which explains the concomitant reduction in risk of coronary heart disease diet was assessed using a 10 d weighed record in 301 smokers at baseline 153 at 4month followup of whom twentysix had quit smoking and 122 at 1year followup of whom twenty had quit compared with continuing smokers those who had quit at the 4month followup mean 10 and 13 weeks for men and women respectively had statistically significant increases in body weight 5 energy intake 13 total dietary fat 24 all specific types of dietary fat 26 polyunsaturated fat 26 linoleic acid 30 eicosapentaenoic acid 23 monounsaturated fat and 22 saturated fat and vitamin e intake 19 the foods which appeared to contribute to increases in energy and fat intakes at the 4month followup were vegetable oils and polyunsaturated margarines processed meats and meat pies by followup at 1 year mean time since quitting 31 and 41 weeks for men and women respectively there were no detectable differences in energy and total fat intakes however intakes of eicosapentaenoic acid and pteroylglutamate folate were statistically significantly higher in the quitters compared with the continuing smokers 37 for eicosapentaenoic acid and 16 for folate we conclude that the shortterm increase in dietary intake of linoleic acid which is not sustained by 1 year cannot explain the reduction in risk of coronary disease following smoking cessation
aims the present study was to inform about alcohol consumption in 1988 persons with diabetes who had been recruited in 18 centres of germany in the year 2000 and to reveal potential differences in the daily dietary intakes and other characteristics between those regularly taking alcoholic drinks and those never or rarely drinking alcohol methods a standardized questionnaire was used to assess demographic data risk factors and medication of the patients intakes of alcoholic drinks ie of beer wine and spirits as well as daily food intakes were evaluated by employing a validated food frequency questionnaire results 16  of the persons with diabetes 26  male 75  female reported to regularly consume alcoholic drinks 36 timesweek onceday or several timesday while 38  25  male 50  female reported no or very little less than oncemonth alcohol intake total alcohol intake was significantly higher in men than in women 77 gday vs 28 gday p 00001 the nondiabetic german population according to the 1998 national health survey consumed more alcohol than the diabetic subgroup of the survey males 116 vs 93 g alcoholday females 53 vs 29 g alcoholday and the persons with diabetes included in the present study persons with diabetes regularly drinking alcohol have been found to consume less frequently vegetables salads fruit wholemeal bread and margarine but more often butter sausages fast food chocolate and chips those who preferred wine ate more frequently wholemeal bread cheese fruit and lowfat food than those who preferred beer the upper limit of alcohol intake per day according to the recommendations of the german diabetes association was exceeded by 48  of the female and 23 of the male persons with diabetes conclusions it is supposed that about 36  of the persons with diabetes regularly exceed the upper limit of admissible alcohol intake compared with those who never or rarely drink alcohol the diet of regular drinkers contains less carbohydrates and dietary fibre but more fat persons with diabetes who prefer wine show a more favourable dietary pattern than those who prefer beer alcohol consumption by persons with diabetes is lower than in the nondiabetic population

objective to determined whether the nature of the lipid in an oral stimulus modifies postprandial triacylglycerolemia methods sixteen healthy adults eight male eight female participated in six test sessions conducted weekly the test sessions were administered randomly after overnight fasts and included ingestion of 50 grams of butter in capsules to avoid oral stimulation with lipids and 500 ml of water in 15 minutes followed by oral stimulation with one of the following foods on a cracker butter unsaturated fatty acid ufa margarine jelly ufa margarine  jelly cracker alone or no oral stimulation sensory stimulation entailed masticating and expectorating similar to50 g samples of each stimulus every three minutes for 110 minutes blood was drawn immediately after preload ingestion and at minutes 35 851 200 320 and 440 post loading and analyzed for serum triacylglycerol tag insulin and glucose concentrations results only the oral samples containing the ufa margarine led to significant elevations of serum tag concentration compared to baseline p  005 maximum change of tag concentrations were greater following orosensory stimulation with ufa margarine compared to orosensory stimulation with butter jelly or ufa margarine  jelly no differences were observed relative to vehicle alone or no orosensory stimulation but this is due to lower nadir values for these treatments insulin and glucose concentrations were not different between treatments conclusion oral exposure specifically to an unsaturated dietary lipid augments the postprandial rise of tag compared to baseline
phosphatidylcholines pcs with plateletactivating factor paflike biological activities are known to be generated by fragmentation of the sn2esterified polyunsaturated fatty acvl group the reaction is free radicalmediated and triggered by oxidants such as metal ions oxyhemoglobin and organic hydroperoxides in this study we characterized the paflike phospholipids produced on reaction of pc having a linoleate group with lipoxygenase enzymes at low oxygen concentrations when the oxidized pcs were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry two types of oxidatively fragmented pc were detected one pc had an sn2short chain saturated or unsaturated acyl group c8c13 with an aldehydic terminal the abundant species were pcs with c9 and c13 the other pc had a short chain saturated acyl group c6c9 with a methyl terminal and the most predominant species was pc with c8 when the extracts of oxidation products were subjected to catalytic hydrogenation pcs having saturated acyl groups c6c14 were detected the most abundant was c12 species the less regiospecific formation of paflike lipids suggests that they were generated by oxidative fragmentation of pc hydroperoxides formed by nonstereoselective oxygenation of the alkyl radical of esterified linoleate that escaped from the active centers of lipoxygenases one of the paflike pc with an aldehydic terminal was found to be bioactive it inhibited the production of nitric oxide induced by lipopolysaccharide and interferongamma in vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta
the partial hydrogenation of sunflower oil with minimum transisomer formation is studied using a pdgammaalumina catalyst modified with promoters apt for human consumption ethyl benzoate and magnesium glycinate it was found that the hydrogenation rate diminishes with the additions of the modifiers regarding the cistransselectivity significant differences were found ethyl benzoate promoted the formation of transisomers whereas magnesium glycinate diminished it the results can be interpreted in terms of different effects change in the electron density of palladium which affects the relative adsorption strength of the reactant intermediates and hydrogen and a block of part of the surface by the modifiers theoretical calculations were performed to support this hypothesis c 2008 elsevier bv all rights reserved
in an attempt to develop strategies for enhancing the nutritional value of sheep milk fat dairy ewe diet was supplemented with 3 incremental levels of marine algae ma in combination with sunflower oil to evaluate the effects of these marine lipids on milk fatty acid fa profile and animal performance fifty assaf ewes in mid lactation were distributed in 10 lots of 5 animals each and allocated to 5 treatments 2 lots per treatment no lipid supplementation control or supplementation with 25 g of sunflower oilkg of dm plus 0 so 8 soma 16 soma2 or 24 soma3 9 of ma 567 ether extractkg of dm milk production and composition including fa profile were analyzed on d 0 3 7 14 21 and 28 of treatment neither intake nor milk yield were significantly affected by lipid addition but all ma supplements decreased milk fat content from d 14 onward reaching a 30 reduction after 28 d on soma3 this milk fat depression might be related not only to the joint action of some putative fat synthesis inhibitors such as trans9cis11 c182 and probably trans10 c181 but also to the limited ability of the mammary gland to maintain a desirable milk fat fluidity that would have been caused by the noticeable increase in transc181 together with the lowered availability of stearic acid for oleic acid synthesis through delta9desaturase furthermore all lipid supplements and mainly ma reduced the secretion of de novo fa c60c140 without increasing the yield of preformed fa c16 supplementation with sunflower oil plus ma resulted in larger increases in cis9trans11 c182 than those observed with sunflower oil alone achieving a mean content as high as 322 of total fa and representing a more than 7fold increase compared with the control vaccenic acid trans11 c181 was also significantly enhanced on average 794 in soma treatments as was c226 n3 dha content although the transfer efficiency of the latter from the diets to the milk was very low 5 however the highest levels of ma inclusion soma2 and soma3 reduced the milk n6n3 ratio but ma supplements caused an important increase in trans10 c181 which would rule out the possibility that this milk has a healthier fat profile before determining the specific role of each individual fa and ensuring that this transmfa is at least innocuous in relation to cardiovascular disease risk

epidemiological clinical and metabolic research has shown a strong association between dietary fatty acids intake and cardiovascular disease cvd risk factors and clinical events saturated fatty acids spa and trans fatty acids tfa derived from industrial hydrogenation of oils have been associated with an increased prevalence of cvd however experimental results on the relationship between physiologicalpathologic effects and specific functions of individual sfa are often contradictory therefore a more detailed exploration of the potential benefit and risks of specific saturated and trans fatty acids is needed in order to update dietary recommendations in the case of tfas the deleterious effect on cvd has been well demonstrated and a maximum accepted level of 1  of total energy has been agreed internationally what is currently under discussion is what would be the best alternative to replace them in the diet rev med chile 2011 139 924931
plant sterols ps are naturally occurring compounds found in foods of plantbased origin despite their structural similarity with cholesterol ps are not absorbed in significant quantities their intestinal absorption is less than 2 as compared to 3060 for cholesterol ps partly inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption which is the underlying mechanism of action responsible for their cholesterollowering dirt the cholesterollowering action of ps was already known in the 1950s and to date several metaanalyses have summarised the evidence for their total and ldlcholesterol ldlc lowering effect in intervention studies with different populations consuming a variety of plant sterolenriched foods the effect is dosedependent with an intake around 2 gday resulting in a reduction in ldlc of about 10 on average while doses above 3 gday do not add much additional benefit the cholesterollowering effect of ps is established within a few weeks and is maintained over longer periods as established in longterm efficacy studies lasting up to 85 months the effect of ps is additive to that of a lipidlowering diet and is also effective on top of treatment with lipidlowering drugs like eg statins psenriched foods can contribute to increasing the effectiveness of a heart healthy diet in lowering ldlc and offer a valuable addition to coronary heart disease risk reduction strategies ps and stanols the saturated counterparts of ps are among the first food compounds for which the european food and safety authority approved a disease risk reduction health claim
the fatty acid composition including transfatty acids of 15 margarine samples from the greek market was determined by gasliquid chromatography saturated cismonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids have been found in the ranges of 241533 155503 and 143502 of total fatty acids respectively the transfatty acid content of greek margarines varied from 01 to 19 and was on the average lower than previously reported the high content in saturated fatty acids of the samples examined is criticized there is significant discrepancy between fatty acid composition and the description of the product on the label a concise index to describe fatty acid composition is proposed this index can appear on the label and would give the consumers a much more accurate picture of the fatty acid composition

in the current review there are 19 patents from an initial list of 285 that met the search criteria despite there being slightly fewer than usual there is probably more chemistry described because several of the patents contain some detailed process schemes antidepressants are regular subjects in patents and an enantioselective hydrogenation is described for preparing aminoalcohols that are used as intermediates in producing duloxetine and related drugs a second patent on antidepressants describes a new demethylation method that can be used in the preparation of desvenlafaxine the active metabolite in venlafaxine those readers who are trying to stop smoking may be interested in two patents one is a process to produce chinazoline alkaloids that can be used to treat nicotine addition the second one is a synthetic route to lobelin that is found in certain plants and also helps with smoking cessation as well as treating asthma attacks simulated moving bed methods are usually found in the separation of close boiling isomers in the petrochemicals industry or more recently enantiomers a patent uses the technique in a novel reactor for the preparation of acetals using ionexchange catalysis processes for preparing drugs for the treatment of a number of neurological disorders are described in a number of patents one covers the isolation of aminoindane intermediates for the production of azilect a drug used for treating parkinsonism the process describes various crystallisation methods in another patent improvements in the yields of tetrafluorobenzylanilines are described that claim to give lower levels of a dimer impurity without providing analytical details olanzapine is used to treat schizophrenia and a method of preparing the compound is described that avoids using expensive or toxic reagents employed in alternative processes the hcl salt of atomoxetine is available as the drug strattera and is used to treat hyperactivity a high yield process to produce the salt is disclosed that includes a racemisation step drugs to treat or prevent coronary problems are covered in this selection of patents and a very comprehensive one deals with intermediates for producing statins it describes the stereoselective preparation of a c7 side chain that is common in the statins a stereoselective process for the preparation of chiral azetidinones is described and these can be used to treat atherosclerosis factor xa inhibitors are also used to treat coronary diseases and a patent describes the production of pyrrolidine carboxylic acids that can be useful in preparing these important drugs the process uses the cheap bulk chemical urea although half of it is wasted patents are reviewed that describe processes to prepare drugs for die treatment of viral infections one of these covers a very large amount of work on entecavir for hepatitis b and involves preparing several novel intermediates using a csi oxidation step the other describes dioxolones that are hiv integrase inhibitors it uses a kcontaining base in a coupling reaction that would nromally be expected to require a stronger base the drug gleevec is used for treating leukaemia and the usual synthetic methods require the use of the toxic reagent cyanamide a new process avoids using this compound and like another one mentioned above uses urea a very long and detailed patent describes a new method for producing the antihistamine carebastine despite the amount of information on the proposed process there is a lack of experimental detail to support many of the claims another detailed patent describes an improved method of producing the veterinary antibiotic ceftiofur methionine is a very important amino acid and a new preparation of a alphahydroxyketone is described using a carbenecatalysed umpolung reaction of aldehydes an interesting feature of this patent is that from over 36 million us patents issued since 1976 this is the only one containing the word umpolung in the title a patent details improvements in preparing pioglitazone and rosiglitazone drugs that are used for treating type it diabetes a catalytic hydrogenation process for reducing a cc bond is replaced by using dithionite in water and reduces the safety issues associated with h under pressure there is no legal or commercial significance in the choice of patents in this review although a number of patents describe experiments on kilo scale and above one in particular has only one example but it does report making 50 kilo of material and so it is clearly at an advanced stage of development if not in commercial operation the advantages mentioned in this review are those claimed in the patent unless this reviewer has personal knowledge of the subject
trans fatty acids tfa from industrial sources ie partially hydrogenated vegetable oil phvo have been associated with several chronic human diseases especially coronary heart disease chd the possible contribution of individual tfa to overall chd risk remains largely unknown the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of 2 major trans 181 isomers trans9 181 lelaidic acid ea and trans11 181 vaccenic acid va on plasma lipid biomarkers of chid risk thirtytwo male golden syrian hamsters were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments 1 control western diet 2 phvo supplement 3 ea supplement and 4 va supplement fat supplements were incorporated into the respective treatment diets at 25 g100 g of diet compared with the control diet the phvo diet increased the plasma ratios of total hdlcholesterol and non hdlhdlcholesterol by 17 and 23 respectively in contrast these values decreased by 27 and 46 after the ea treatment and 8 and 14 after the va treatment respectively indicating an improvement reduction in chd risk with regard to liver lipids the ea diet reduced the content of n3 and n6 pufa relative to the other treatments suggesting an inhibition of enzymes common to the 2 biosynthesis pathways overall results demonstrate that the hypercholesterolemic effects of phvo are not dependent on the presence of ea or va and that other bioactive components in phvo must be responsible for its associated adverse health effects j nutr 139 257263 2009
we conducted a casecontrol study in athens greece between january 1990 and april 1991 to examine the association between diet and coronary heart disease the case series comprised 329 patients with electrocardiographically confirmed first coronary infarct or a first positive coronary arteriogram or both who were admitted to a major teaching hospital during a 16month period controls were 570 patients admitted to the same hospital for major conditions believed to be unrelated to nutrition total energy intake was inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk a quintile energy increase corresponding to a relative risk of 096 after controlling for total energy intake dietary fat was positively related to coronary heart disease and total carbohydrates were negatively related to coronary heart disease the nutrientspecific relative risks for a quintile increase being 119 95 confidence interval  096148 and 081 95 confidence interval  067097 respectively major fat components saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat did not appear to have differential risk implications for coronary heart disease however cooking with margarine was associated with an increased relative risk 187 95 confidence interval  082428 dietary proteins cholesterol and vitamin c were not associated with coronary heart disease
chicken is the most widely consumed meat all over the world due to chickens being easy to rear their fast growth rate and the meat having good nutritional characteristics the main objective of this paper was to study the effects of dietary fatty byproducts in low medium and high levels of oxidized lipids and trans fatty acids tfas on the contents of cholesterol and oxycholesterols in meat liver and plasma of chickens a palm fatty acid distillate before and after hydrogenation and a sunflowerolive oil blend 7030 vv before and after use in a commercial frying process were used in feeding trials after adding 6 of the fats to the feeds highly oxidized lipid and tfa feeds significantly increased the contents of cholesterol and oxycholesterols in all tissues of chicken 001  p a parts per thousand currency sign 005 the contents of oxycholesterols in chicken meat liver and plasma obtained from tfa feeding trials varied between 17 and 48 mu g100 g in meat 1942 mu g100 g in liver and 105126 mu gdl in plasma in contrast in the oxidized lipid feeding trials oxycholesterols varied between 13 and 75 mu g100 g in meat 3058 mu g100 g in liver and 66209 mu gdl in plasma meat from chickens fed with feeds containing high levels of tfas or oxidized lipids may contribute to higher ingestion of cholesterol and oxycholesterols by humans
saturated and transfatty acids raise total cholesterol and ldlcholesterol and are known to increase the risk of chd while dietary unsaturated fatty acids play important roles in maintaining cardiovascular health replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats in the diet often involves many complex dietary changes modifying the composition of foods high in saturated fat particularly those foods that are consumed daily can help individuals to meet the nutritional targets for reducing the risk of chd in the 1960s the dutch medical community approached unilever about the technical feasibility of producing margarine with a highpufa and lowsaturated fatty acid composition margarine is an emulsion of water in liquid oil that is stabilised by a network of fat crystals indepth expertise of fat crystallisation processes allowed unilever scientists to use a minimum of solid fat saturated fatty acids to structure a maximum level of pufarich liquid oil thus developing the first bloodcholesterollowering product becel over the years the composition of this spread has been modified to reflect new scientific findings and recommendations the present paper will briefly review the developments in fat technology that have made these improvements possible unilever produces spreads that are low in total fat and saturated fat virtually free of transfatty acids and with levels of n3 and n6 pufa that are in line with the latest dietary recommendations for the prevention of chd individuals with the metabolic syndrome have a 24fold increased risk of developing chd therefore these spreads could make a contribution to chd prevention in this group in addition for individuals with the metabolic syndrome the spreads could be further modified to address their unique dyslipidaemia ie elevated blood triacylglycerols and low hdlcholesterol research conducted in the lipgene study and other dietary intervention studies will deliver the scientific evidence to justify further modifications in the composition of spreads that are healthy for the heart disease risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome
objectives the aims of the study were to provide information that will contribute to conceptualising what is called dietary westernisation and to provide an example of measuring it on an individual level design food consumption frequency and demographic data on adults in mauritius were examined in 1988 1992 and 1998 in 1992 a 24hour recall was also included the crosssectional samples consisted of 1115 age 2574 years mauritians in 198788 1917 age 3074 years in 1992 and 2239 age 2074 years in 1998 principal components analysis was carried out on daily consumption frequencies of 10 indicator foods white rice white bakery bread pulses processed meat poultry freshfrozen fish butter margarine whole milk and skimmedlowfat milk correlations between dietary patterns and selected food consumption frequencies were examined in each survey year results four dietary patterns were identified as being related to dietary westernisation the traditional dietary pattern was characterised by higher consumption frequencies of indian breads saltedsmoked fish and sugarsweetened tea the western dietary pattern was characterised by higher consumption frequencies of cakespastries meat and many western fast foods like burgers but surprisingly also by brown bread breakfast cereals and salad the breadbutter dietary pattern predominantly described more frequent consumption of bread compared with rice the margarinemilk dietary pattern was inconsistently related with staple foods younger educated and wealthier mauritians appeared to adopt western dietary patterns earlier conclusions this study suggests that relatively few indicator foods are needed for measuring dietary westernisation dietary westernisation in a nonwestern country may also include shifts towards voluntary consumption of healthier foods

increased concentrations of serum cholesterol and in particular lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol constitute the main risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular diseases asvd dietary modification increased physical activity weight reduction in overweight people and moderate alcohol consumption form the first line of treatment for hypercholesterolaemia combining the cholesterollowering effect of foods containing plant stanol esters with a lowfat lowcholesterol diet makes it possible to achieve a clinically significant additional reduction in serum cholesterol concentrations beyond that obtained with a lowfat diet alone based on recent studies serum ldl cholesterol decreases by 1824 with this approach to achieve the optimal cholesterollowering effect with foods containing stanol esters consumers should be counselled about the principles of making healthy food choices and appropriate use of food products containing plant stanol esters
milk fat is usually considered to be proatherogenic although its fatty acid composition can vary due mainly to farming conditions no study has evaluated whether such variation can modify the atherogenic properties of dairy fat aortic lipid deposition and related risk factors were examined in syrian hamsters fed diets for 12 wk containing 200 gkg of 2 commercial milk fats high content of saturated fatty acids hsf and low content of saturated fatty acids lsf contrasting respectively in total saturated fatty acids 72 vs 67 g100 g 181 trans 424 vs 726 g100g and conjugated linoleic acid mainly cis9 trans11 or rumenic acid 039 vs 259 g100 g hamsters fed the lsfdiet had 25 less aortic cholesterylester deposition than those fed the hsfdiet this was accompanied by an improved plasma cholesterol profile lower ldl cholesterol and ldlhdl cholesterol ratio a lower local inflammatory status aortic gene expression of cyclooxygenase2 and lower aortic gene expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule1 all p  005 supplementation of the lsfdiet with rumenic acid up to 9 gkg amplified the antiatherogenic effect of the original lsfdiet compared with the hsfdiet ie less aortic cholesterol loading increased reverse cholesterol transport potential higher plasma hdl cholesterol concentration and atpbinding cassette subfamily a transporter 1 gene expression in aorta and decreased ldlperoxidability index and gene expression of proinflammatory il1 beta in the aorta all p  005 in conclusion our results suggest that the atherogenic potential of milk fat can be greatly reduced in products with a naturally high abundance of rumenic acid and argue for increasing this fatty acid in milk
the finnish national food composition database finelir was updated with recent analytical values for plant sterols ps sitosterol campesterol stigmasterol avenasterol brassicasterols and stanols and cholesterol the quality of the new analytical data was assessed the aims of the present study were 1 to compare the effect of old and new database values on ps and cholesterol intakes based on average per capita food consumption data 2 to estimate the current intake and major sources of these compounds in various population groups according to the national findiet 1997 survey data the intake of total ps was 305 mgd for men and 237 mgd for women the respective intakes for cholesterol were 284 mgd and 201 mgd women had a higher density of ps in their diets than men whereas the cholesterol density in the diets did not differ between genders cereals margarine vegetables and vegetable oils were the main food sources of ps meat meat products and eggs were the main sources of cholesterol a 9 greater ps intake estimate was obtained with the new ps database compared with the old ps database probably due to minor methodological differences between the new and old analyses notable changes in analytical methods suggest a lower value  19  for cholesterol intake calculated from the new database compared with the old one we conclude that researchers can have confidence in the new values for ps and cholesterol because systematic evaluation of the new analytical values showed them to be of high quality
objective to assess to what extent the observed dietary changes and increased use of lipidlowering medication can explain the almost 20 decline in serum cholesterol referring to serum total cholesterol level observed from 1982 to 2007 in finland design predicted changes of serum cholesterol were calculated by the keys equation assuming the effect of trans fatty acids to be similar to sfa and using the dietary intake data of the national dietary surveys between 1982 and 2007 the effect of medication was estimated based on the information on use of lipidlowering medication among survey participants the predicted serum cholesterol levels were compared with observed changes in analysed serum cholesterol levels setting four crosssectional population surveys in 1982 1992 2002 and 2007 in the provinces of north karelia northern savo and southwestern finland subjects a total of 2325 men and 2638 women aged 2664 years selected randomly from the national population register for the four surveys results changes in dietary fat quality and cholesterol intake explain 070 mmoll 65 of the decrease in men and 065 mmoll 60 of the decrease in women in all subjects decline in dietary sfa intake is the main explanatory factor 47 in men and 41 in women for the changes the impact of lipidlowering medication on observed cholesterol levels was found to be 16 among men and 7 among women conclusions the decrease in serum cholesterol levels in finland can be explained mainly by dietary changes especially changes in fat quality the effect of lipidlowering medication is less significant
background high intakes of trans fatty acids tfa have been found to exert an undesirable effect on serum lipid profiles and thus may increase the risk fur cardiovascular disease objective investigation of the association between tfa intake and serum lipids design crosssectional study in eight european countries finland france greece iceland the netherlands portugal spain sweden among 327 men and 299 women 5065 y using a dietary history method food consumption was assessed and tfa intake was calculated with recent figures on tfa levels of foods collected in the transfair study results mean sd tfa intake was 240153 gday for men and 198149 gday for women 08704896 and 095055 of energy respectively with the highest consumption in iceland and the lowest in the mediterranean countries no associations were found between total tfa intake and ldl hdl or ldlhdl ratio after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors additional adjustment for other fatty acid clusters resulted in a significant inverse trend between total tfa intake and total cholesterol ptrend  003 the most abundantly occuring tfa isomer c181 t contributed substantially to this inverse association the tfa isomers c141 t9 c161 t9 and c221 t were nut associated or were positively associated with ldl or total cholesterol conclusions from this study we conclude that at the current european intake levels of trans fatty acids they are not associated with an unfavourable serum lipid profile sponsorship unilever research laboratorium the dutch dairy foundation on nutrition and health cargill bv the institute of food research norwich laboratory the nutrition branch of the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food the international fishmeal and oil manufacturers association kraft foods nv vandemoortele coordination center danone group mcdonalds dc deutschland ins danish veterinary and food administration valio ltd raisio group descriptors trans fatty acids dietary intake cholesterol level cardiovascular risk factors

the opinion of nutritional science on the effect of trans fatty acids on blood cholesterol has drastically changed during the last decode as a reaction to these new findings the european margarine industry decided in the mid nineties to eliminate trans containing components from their margarine fat phase compositions this excluded practically the use of partially hydrogenated oils and fats transfree margarines have been introduced with optimised fat crystal structures stabilising a maximum of water in oil emulsion with a minimum of solid fat phase these fat crystal structures ore formed by fat phase components obtained from interesterification andor fractionation of nonhydrogenated andor fully hydrogenated feedstocks
background maternaln3 n6 and trans fatty acids are claimed to affect fetal growth yet evidence is limited objective we investigated the association between maternal n3 n6 and trans fatty acids measured early in pregnancy and fetal growth design amsterdam pregnant women n  12 373 were invited to complete a questionnaire response 67 and donate blood around the 12th pregnancy week for nutrient analysis for 4336 women fatty acid concentrations were measured in plasma phospholipids gasliquid chromatography associations of these concentrations with birth weight and smallforgestationalage sga risk were analyzed liveborn singleton term deliveries n  3704 results low concentrations of individual n3 fatty acids and 203n6 the precursor of arachidonic acid 204n6 but high concentrations of the other n6 fatty acids and the main dietary trans fatty acid 18 1 n  9t were associated with lower birth weight estimated difference in univariate analysis 52 to  172 g for extreme quintile compared with middle quintile in general sga risk increased accordingly after adjustment for physiologic lifestylerelated and sociodemographic factors low concentrations of most n3 fatty acids and 203n6 and high concentrations of 204n6 remained associated with lower birth weight 52 to 57 g higher sga risk or both odds ratios 138150 infants of the 7 of women with the most adverse fatty acid profile were on average 125 g lighter and twice as likely to be small for gestational age conclusion an adverse maternal fatty acid profile early in pregnancy is associated with reduced fetal growth which if confirmed gives perspective for the dietary prevention of lower birth weight
the effects of trans fatty acids on intestinal lipoprotein secretion were determined in polarized caco2 cells palmitic acid 160 palmitoleic acid c161 delta 9 and palmitelaidic acid t161 delta 9 as well as stearic acid 180 oleic acid c181 delta 9 cvaccenic acid c181 delta 11 elaidic acid t181 delta 9 and tvaccenic acid t181 delta 11 were studied compared with 180 control c and t181 delta 9 increased triacylglycerol secretion 27 and 36fold respectively as well as apolipoprotein apo b48 and apo b100 secretion both 16fold compared with 180 c and t181 delta 11 caused a modest 17fold increase in triacylglycerol secretion with no significant effect on secretion of apo b thus the position of the double bond in the 181 isomers but not its geometrical configuration affected lipoprotein secretion by caco2 cells in contrast the effects of the geometrical isomers cis and trans of c16 fatty acids were not comparable t161 delta 9 did not affect triacylglycerol and apo b secretion compared with 160 as control whereas c161 delta 9 was a potent stimulator of secretion of triacylglycerol 24fold higher than 160 apo b48 13fold higher than 160 and apo b100 15fold higher than 160 we conclude that the carbon chain length of fatty acids as well as the position of double bonds and their stereochemical configuration are important determinants of the unique effects of various species of dietary tr ails fatty acids on lipoprotein secretion and composition in caco2 cells
a high intake of trans fatty acids tfas has been shown to have an undesirable effect on serum lipid profiles and lipoproteina lpa levels and may thereby increase the risk for coronary heart disease chd we performed a study in chd patients and measured the tfa concentration of the plasma phospholipid fraction comparison was made between a case group with angiographically documented severe chd  80 stenosis in one coronary vessel n  83 and a control group of patients who had just minor stenosis on the coronary angiography  50 stenosis in all three major vessels n  78 all subjects were under 68 years of age and were prestratified on age gender and smoking habits the two groups were comparable according to the prestratification criteria body mass index blood pressure number of cigarettes smoked and total fat intake controls had higher plasma hdl levels p  0001 and lower albeit not significantly lower p  007 plasma ldl levels no significant correlations were found between percentages of tfas in plasma phospholipids and plasma ldl or hdl cholesterol levels of the major fatty acid classes only the percentage of saturated fatty acids was significantly higher in cases 462  092 than in controls 458  107 means  sd the difference in total tfa content between cases and controls 032  002 versus 035  002 was 003 p  02 for the specific tfas c161n  7tr c181n  9tr and c182n  6tr just minor differences were found adjusted odds ratios for tertiles of tfa percentages were 056 025123 and 076 036161 for the highest and middle tertile compared to the lowest these findings do not support an association between tfa intake and risk for coronary heart disease
the average diet may provide some 810 gday of unsaturated fatty acids with a trans double bond previous studies showed that dietary trans fatty acids may simultaneously raise lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and reduce highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol human plasma contains a protein cetp which transfers cholesterylesters from hdl to lipoproteins of lower density we hypothesized that cetp could play a role in the effect of trans fatty acids on lipoproteins and measured the activity levels of cetp in serum samples from a 9week study in which 55 volunteers were fed three controlled diets with different fatty acid profiles mean activity was 114  of reference serum after consumption of a high trans fatty acid diet as opposed to 96 after linoleic acid and 97 after stearic acid p  002 we conclude that the increased activity of cetp may contribute to the rise in ldl cholesterol and the fall in hdl cholesterol seen on diets with high contents of trans fatty acids
concomitant administration of statins with food may alter statin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics increasing the risk of adverse reactions such as myopathy or rhabdomyolysis or reducing their pharmacological action this paper reviews major interactions between statins and dietary compounds consumption of pectin or oat bran together with lovastatin reduces absorption of the drug while alcohol intake does not appear to affect the efficacy and safety of fluvastatin treatment grapefruit juice components inhibit cytochrome p4503a4 reducing the presystemic metabolism of drugs such as simvastatin lovastatin and atorvastatin followup studies on the therapeutic effect of statins in patients consuming a mediterraneanstyle diet are necessary to assure the correct prescription because the oilstatin and minor oil compoundstatin possible interactions have been only briefly studied preliminary study suggests that olive oil can increase the hypolipaemiant effect of simvastatin with respect sunflower oil the consumption of polyunsaturated rich oils throughout the cytochrome p450 activation could decrease the halflife of some statins and therefore their hypolipaemic effects the statins and n3 fatty acids combined therapy gives rise to pharmacodinamic interaction that improves the lipid profile and leads greater cardioprotection although statins are more effective in high endogenous cholesterol production subjects and plant sterols are more effective in high cholesterol absorption efficacy subjects plant esterolsstatins combined therapy generates very positive complementary effects this review ends suggesting possible dietstain interactions that require further investigations eg types of olive oils fruit juices other than grapefruit fibre or consumption of alcoholic beverages rich in polyphenols or ethanol

lipids obtained from dairy products are an important part of the human diet in many countries approximately 75 of the total consumption of fat from ruminant animals comes from bovine milk fat trans fatty acids tfa are produced during biohydrogenation of mono and polyunsaturated fa in the rumen they are mixtures of positional and geometrical isomers that are incorporated into the milk fat of lactating cows the most important sources of tfa in the human diet are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and ruminant milk and meat products ruminantderived lipids often contain 18 of total fatty acids as tfa which are predominantly 181 isomers the most common fa in ruminant fat is vaccenic acid 181 trans11 va accounting for 6080 of total tfa unlike other tfa va can be converted to rumenic acid ra through the action of stearoyl coenzymea desaturase today consumers are becoming aware of the relationship between dietary fat health maintenance and disease prevention these concerns have increased the need to investigate the metabolic fate and bioactivity of dietary fa by altering the nutrition of cows farmers can markedly and rapidly modulate the fa composition of milk fa the largest changes can be obtained either by feeding animals highquality forage particularly fresh pasture or by adding plant or marine oils to the diet given that economic factors define future profits for farmers diet manipulation may be the most practical and appropriate approach to change milks fa composition
background partially hydrogenated fat has an unfavorable effect on cardiovascular disease risk palm oil is a potential substitute because of favorable physical characteristics objective we assessed the effect of palm oil on lipoprotein profiles compared with the effects of both partially hydrogenated fat and oils high in monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids design fifteen volunteers aged  50 y with ldl cholesterol  130 mgdl were provided with food for each of 4 diets 35 dphase varying in type of fat partially hydrogenated soybean soybean palm or canola twothirds fat 20 of energy plasma fatty acid profiles lipids lipoproteins apolipoprotein ai apolipoprotein 13 lipoproteina glucose insulin hdl subtractions and indicators of lipoprotein metabolism hdlcholesterol fractional esterification rate cholesteryl ester transfer protein phospholipid transfer protein and paraoxonase activities were measured at the end of each phase results plasma fatty acid profiles reflected the main source of dietary fat partially hydrogenated soybean and palm oils resulted in higher ldlcholesterol concentrations than did soybean 12 and 14 respectively p  005 and canola 16 and 18 p  005 oils apolipoprotein b p  005 and ai p  005 concentrations mirrored the pattern of ldl and hdlcholesterol concentrations respectively no significant effect on the totaltohdl cholesterol ratio was observed for palm oil compared with the other dietary fats hdl3 cholesterol was higher after palm oil than after partially hydrogenated and soybean oils p  005 differences in measures of glucose and hdl intravascular processing attributable to dietary fat were small conclusion palm and partially hydrogenated soybean oils compared with soybean and canola oils adversely altered the lipoprotein profile in moderately hyperlipidemic subjects without significantly affecting hdl intravascular processing markers

trans isomers of alpha linolenic acid which are formed by deodorization of refined vegetable oils can be found in significant amounts in edible oils effects of trans ollinolenic acid on plasma lipoproteins are unknown we therefore investigated the effects of trans alpha linolenic acid on plasma lipids and lipoproteins in healthy european men eightyeight healthy men from three european countries france scotland uk and the netherlands first consumed for 6 weeks a diet with experimental oils free of trans fatty acids runin period for the next 6 weeks they were randomly allocated to a diet with experimental oils high or low in trans alpha linolenic acid daily total trans alpha linolenic acid intake in the high trans group was 1410 range 5832642 mg experimental oils were provided as such or incorporated into margarines cheeses muffins and biscuits the high trans alpha linolenic acid diet significantly increased the plasma ldlhdlcholesterol ratio by 81  95  ci 14 153 p  002 and the total cholesterolhdlcholesterol ratio by 51  95  ci 04 99 p  003 compared with the lowtrans diet this was largely explained by an increase in ldlcholesterol on the hightrans diet while no change was observed in the lowtrans group mean treatment effect of 47  95  ci 08 105 p  010 no effects were found on total cholesterol and hdlcholesterol triacylglycerols apolipoprotein b and a1 and lipoproteina concentrations in conclusion trans alpha linolenic acid may increase plasma ldlhdlcholesterol and total cholesterolhdlcholesterol ratios whether dietinduced changes in these ratios truly affects the risk for chd remains to be established
trans fatty acids may be involved in atherosclerotic vascular diseases we investigated the incorporation of dietary trans fatty acids and oleic acid into the serum triglycerides tc cholesterol esters ce and phospholipids pl fourteen healthy female volunteers aged 232  31 yr mean  sd body mass index 208  21 kgm2 participated in this study all subjects consumed both a trans fatty acidenriched diet trans diet and an oleic acidenriched diet oleic diet for 4 wk according to a randomized crossover design both experimental diet periods were preceded by consumption of a baseline diet for 2 wk which supplied 37 of total energy e as fat 18 e from saturated fatty acids sfa 12 e from monounsaturated fatty acids and 6 e from polyunsaturated fatty acids five e of the sfa in the baseline diet was replaced by trans fatty acids 181 t and 182ct  182tt where c is cis and t is trans in the trans diet and by oleic acid 181 n9 in the oleic diet after the trans diet the proportions of 18it and 182t increased p  0001 in all serum lipid fractions analyzed the increase of 18it in tc and pl 180  028 vs 526  140 107  034 vs 339  076 mol of total fatty acids respectively was markedly higher than that in ce 044  007 vs 092  026 whereas that of 182t was nearly the same in all three fractions the proportions of palmitic stearic arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids in tg ce and pl and that of oleic acid in tg and ce were decreased when compared with the baseline value in contrast the proportion of palmitoleic acid in tg and pl and that of linoleic acid in pl increased on the trans diet after consumption of the oleic diet the proportion of oleic acid increased in all three lipid fractions analyzed and the percentage increase was nearly the same in all fractions in contrast the proportions of 181t in tg and pl and 182t in tg and ce decreased when compared with the baseline value in conclusion a moderate increase in dietary trans fatty acids resulted in a marked incorporation into serum lipids and decreased the conversion of linoleic acid to its more unsaturated longchain metabolites analysis of 181t from serum tg and pl seems to reflect reliably the dietary intake of this fatty acid
the hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic effects of vegetable oil and woodbased dietary plant stanol esters were compared in female apoe3leiden transgenic mice at relevant plasma cholesterol levels the plant stanol esters derived from vegetable oil sitostanol 657 campestanol 301 had different contents of sitostanol and campestanol than the plant stanol esters derived from wood sitostanol 876 campestanol 95 or from a mixture of vegetable oil and wood sitostanol 730 campestanol 247 the mice 10 per group received for 38 weeks a control diet or diets containing 10 ww plant stanol esters derived from either vegetable oil wood or a mixture of both vegetable oil 46 wood 42 and vegetable oilwood 51 plant stanol esters decreased the plasma cholesterol levels p  00001 by reducing the cholesterol content in plasma very low density intermediate density and to a lesser extent in low densitylipoprotein plant stanol ester feeding did not change plasma triglyceride levels dietary plant stanol esters reduced the atherosclerotic lesion area by 91  13 vegetable oil 97  4 wood and 78  34 vegetable oilwood p  00001 and the severity from regular intimal fatty streaksmild plaques on average type 23 lesions in controls to individual intimal foam cells   type 1 lesions in the treatment groups p  00001 plant stanol esters had no effect on adherence of monocytes to the vessel wall feeding of plant stanol esters dramatically reduced independent of its sources the extent and severity of atherosclerotic lesions by decreasing vldl idl and to a lesser extent ldlcholesterol in apoe3leiden transgenic mice c 2001 elsevier science ireland ltd all rights reserved
the objective of the present study was to assess the effect of consumption of a yoghurtbased drink enriched with 12 g plant sterolsd on serum lipids transaminases vitamins and hormone status in patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolaemia thirty patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups a lowfat lowlactose yoghurtbased drink enriched with 1 g plant sterol extracted from soyabeand v a lowfat lowlactose yoghurt for a period of 4 weeks after a 2week washout period patients were crossed over for an additional 4week period second after a 4week washout period eleven patients were treated with 2 g plant sterolsd in a second open part of the study for a period of 8 weeks the yoghurt enriched with plant sterols significantly reduced in a dosedependent manner serum total cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels and ldlcholesterolhdlcholesterol p 0001 whereas no changes were observed in hdlcholesterol and triacylglycerol levels either in the first or the second part of the study there were only slight not statistically significant differences in serum transaminase vitamin and hormone levels to conclude a lowfat yoghurtbased drink moderately enriched with plant sterols may lower total cholesterol and ldlcholesterol effectively in patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolaemia
objective intake of alphalinolenic acid may have a beneficial effect on coronary heart disease but little information is available on the intake and sources of alphalinolenic acid c183 n  3 in populations we therefore assessed intake and sources of alphalinolenic acid in dutch elderly men design and subjects dietary histories were obtained from participants of the zutphen elderly study a dutch cohort study food consumption data were available from 876 men in 1985 and from 541 of the same men in 1990 daily intakes of alphalinolenic acid were assessed using a food table developed for this purpose alphalinolenic acid content of edible fats seafood and some commonly eaten dishes were mainly derived from chemical analyses of dutch foods and other values were obtained from published food tables results alphalinolenic acid provided 05  01 of energy intake mean  sd or 130  046 gday in 1985 and 121  052 gday in 1990 the pearson correlation coefficient for intake of alphalinolenic acid in 1985 and 1990 was 034 margarines were the main source 254 followed by meat and the fats used in cooking meat 108 bread 98 and vegetables 78 conclusions an increase in intake of alphalinolenic acid is most easily realized by the use of unhydrogenated oils rich in alphalinolenic acid such as rapeseed and soybean oil and of margarines and other fats containing such oils sponsorship this research was supported by the dutch praeventie fonds the hague the national institute of public health and the environment and the department of human nutrition wageningen agricultural university
familial hypercholesterolaemia fh is an autosomal codominantly inherited condition resulting from mutations of the lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptor which occur in heterozygous form in approximately one in 500 individuals clinically fh is characterized by 23fold elevation of serum ldl cholesterol levels accelerated development of atherosclerotic vascular disease and if untreated shortened lifespan the finnish population which represents a genetic isolate offers exceptional possibilities for geneticepidemiological studies on fh as a handful of founder gene mutations account for the majority of fh cases in finland this review summarizes data from our fh studies carried out since 1985 we wish to emphasize the continuum of genotypephenotype relationships the importance of molecular diagnosis the detection of novel risk factors of vascular disease and innovations inhibiting cholesterol absorption for the modern treatment of fh
in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia fh serum low density lipoprotein in ldl cholesterol levels are already elevated at birth premature coronary heart disease occurs in approximate to 30 of heterozygous untreated adult patients accordingly to retard development of atherosclerosis preventive measures for lowering cholesterol should be started even in childhood to this end 19 fh families consumed dietary stanol ester for 3 months stanol ester margarine lowers the serum cholesterol level by inhibiting cholesterol absorption each individual in the study replaced part of his or her daily dietary fat with 25 g of 80 rapeseed oil margarine containing stanol esters 224 gd stanols mainly sitostanol the families who consumed this margarine for 12 weeks included 24 children aged 3 to 13 years with the north karelia variant of fh fhnk 4 fhnk parents and 16 healthy family members and a separate group of 12 fhnk adults who consumed the margarine for 6 weeks and who were on simvastatin therapy 20 or 40 mgd fatsoluble vitamins were measured by highpressure liquid chromatography and cholesterol precursor sterols indexes of cholesterol synthesis and cholestanol and plant sterols indexes of cholesterol absorption efficiency were assayed by gasliquid chromatography no side effects occurred serum ldl cholesterol levels were reduced by 18 p0001 11 12 p0001 and 20 p0001 in the 4 groups respectively the serum campesteroltocholesterol rations fell by 31 p0001 29 23 p0001 and 36 p0001 respectively suggesting that cholesterol absorption efficiency was inhibited serum lathosterol ratios were elevated by 38 p0001 11 15 p0001 and 19 p0001 respectively suggesting that cholesterol synthesis was compensatorily upregulated the fmnk children increased their serum lathosterol ratio more than did the fhnk adults treated with stanol ester margarine and simvastatin p001 in the fhnk children serum retinol concentration and alphatocopheroltocholesterol ratios were unchanged by stanol ester margarine but alpha and betacarotene concentrations and ratios were decreased as assayed in a genetically defined population of fh patients a dietary regimen with stanol ester margarine proved to be a safe and effective hypolipidemic treatment for children and adults in fhnk adults on simvastatin therapy serum ldl cholesterol levels could be reduced even further by including a stanol ester margarine in the regimen
on the austrian market a selection of the available margarines refined and cold pressed plant oils chocolate spreads snacks and fast food products were collected and the content of transfatty acids tfa was determined by a glc procedure the highest levels of tfa were observed in fast food products mean 59 maximum 21 of fatty acids chocolate spreads mean 49 maximum 89 of fatty acids and snacks mean 29 maximum 16 of fatty acids margarines with a 1 tfa declaration contained low amounts 0308 while the content of margarines with no such declaration was much higher 3037 a 7 h oxidation of plant oils at 120 degrees c demonstrated that the higher levels of tfa in heated oils are not associated with oxidation processes at this temperature based on the analysed data the mean tfa intake currently  4 gday has decreased due to a change in manufacturing conditions and the choice of unhydrogenated plant oils in spite of this a diet high in snacks fast food products or chocolate spreads all products which are popular amongs children and adolescents may increase the tfa intake up to 10 gday
due to reported detrimental health effects of diets high in trans fatty acids tfa in particular on blood lipids convenience products trade margarines fats for cooking and frying and fast food products available on the austrian market were comprehensively investigated on tfa using gas chromatography about half of the tested convenience products contained less than 1 tfa one third less than 5 but almost 5 of the tested products more than 20 tfa a similar allocation could be found in fast food products with the highest tfa level of 89 total tfa of household fats were lower 145  199 than fats of industrial use 783  100 p  0001 compared to investigations in austria and germany around 10 years ago the tfa content of the tested foods had decreased significantly about half of the investigated products contained less than 1 tfatotal fatty acids however very high amounts of tfa  15 can still be detected and an intake of more that 5 g tfaportion which has been shown to significantly increase the risk for cardiovascular disease is easily possible c 2007 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
conjugated linoleic acids clas comprise a family of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid 182n  6 la that are formed by biohydrogenation and oxidation processes in nature the major dietary sources of these unusual fatty acids are foods derived from ruminant animals in particular dairy products the main form of cla cis9 trans 11182 can be produced directly by bacterial hydrogenation in the rumen or by delta9 desaturation of the coproduct vaccenic acid trans11181 in most mammalian tissues including man the second most abundant isomer of cla is the trans10 cis12182 form initially identified in grilled beef as a potential anticarcinogen a surprising number of health benefits have subsequently been attributed to cla mixtures and more recently to the main individual isoforms it is also clear from recent studies that the two main isoforms can have different effects on metabolism and cell functions and can act through different cell signalling pathways the majority of studies on body compositional effects ie fat loss lean gain on cancer and cardiovascular disease attenuation on insulin sensitivity and diabetes and on immune function have been conducted with a variety of animal models observations clearly emphasise that differences exist between mammalian species in their response to clas with mice being the most sensitive recent studies indicate that some but not all of the effects observed in animals also pertain to human volunteers reports of detrimental effects of cla intake appear to be largely in mice and due mainly to the trans10 cis12 isomer suggestions of possible deleterious effects in man due to an increase in oxidative lipid products isoprostanes with trans10 cis12 cla ingestion require substantiation unresponsiveness to antioxidants of these nonenzymatic oxidation products casts some doubt on their physiological relevance recent reports albeit in the minority that clas particularly the trans10 cis12 isomer can elicit procarcinogenic effects in animal models of colon and prostate cancer and can increase prostaglandin production in cells also warrant further investigation and critical evaluation in relation to the many published anticancer and antiprostaglandin effects of clas c 2004 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

consumption of industrially produced transfatty acids tfa is associated with substantial risk of coronary heart disease chd the magnitude of this relationship as well as emerging associations with end points such as diabetes and sudden cardiac death cannot be fully explained by the wellestablished adverse effects of tfa on serum lipids we review the evidence for effects of tfa intake on nonlipid risk factors based on evidence from randomized controlled trials observational studies animal experiments and in vitro studies these include effects on systemic inflammation endothelial dysfunction visceral adiposity insulin resistance and arrhythmic risk the types and strength of evidence for each of these nonlipid effects varies but the overall constellation of findings is qualitatively and quantitatively unique among dietary fats the multiple adverse effects and implicated pathways are consistent with the observed strong associations of tfa consumption with chd risk these nonlipid effects also explain why tfa consumption may adversely impact other nonchd diseases and end points
the dietary polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to have chemopreventive activity against cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers in model systems but it is not clear whether the drug reaches the proposed sites of action in vivo after oral ingestion especially in humans in this study we examined the absorption bioavailability and metabolism of c14resveratrol after oral and iv doses in six human volunteers the absorption of a dietary relevant 25mg oral dose was at least 70 with peak plasma levels of resveratrol and metabolites of 49190 ngml about 2 mum and a plasma halflife of 9206 h however only trace amounts of unchanged resveratrol 5 ngml could be detected in plasma most of the oral dose was recovered in urine and liquid chromatographymass spectrometry analysis identified three metabolic pathways ie sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation of the phenolic groups and interestingly hydrogenation of the aliphatic double bond the latter likely produced by the intestinal microflora extremely rapid sulfate conjugation by the intestineliver appears to be the ratelimiting step in resveratrols bioavailability although the systemic bioavailability of resveratrol is very low accumulation of resveratrol in epithelial cells along the aerodigestive tract and potentially active resveratrol metabolites may still produce cancerpreventive and other effects
the aim is to explore changes in food habits after migration and the resultant present food consumption patterns as well as the effect of demographic socioeconomic and integration factors on these changes analyses were based on data collected through the oslo immigrant health study from 629 persons 3060 years of age born in sri lanka and pakistan and living in oslo norway a majority of the sri lankans reported increase in the consumption of meat milk butter margarine and potatoes around half of those from pakistan reported increased consumption of oil meat fish and potatoes both groups reported a decrease in bean and lentil consumption multivariate regression showed that age was negatively related to increases in butter and margarine consumption and a good command of the norwegian language reduced the likelihood of increased consumption of oil and butter the likelihood of having present fat and sugar rich food patterns were reduced with age and years of education whereas scoring high on an index of integration increased the likelihood of a fat rich food pattern in conclusion a number of demographic and sociocultural factors may modify the changes in food habits after migration some of these may have substantial health implications c 2007 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
background trans fatty acids are produced either by industrial hydrogenation or by biohydrogenation in the rumens of cows and sheep industrial trans fatty acids lower highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol raise lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and increase the risk of coronary heart disease the effects of trans fatty acids from ruminants are less clear we investigated the effect on blood lipids of cis9 trans11 conjugated linoleic acid cla a trans fatty acid largely restricted to ruminant fats methodologyprincipal findings sixtyone healthy women and men were sequentially fed each of three diets for three weeks in random order for a total of nine weeks diets were identical except for 7 of energy approximately 20 gday which was provided either by oleic acid by industrial trans fatty acids or by a mixture of 80 cis9 trans11 and 20 trans10 cis12 cla after the oleic acid diet mean  sd serum ldl cholesterol was 268  062 mmoll compared to 300  066 mmoll after industrial trans fatty acids p  0001 and 292  070 mmoll after cla p  0001 compared to oleic acid hdlcholesterol was 005  012 mmoll lower after industrial trans fatty acids p  0001 and 006  010 mmoll lower after cla p  0001 the totaltohdl cholesterol ratio was 116 higher after industrial trans fatty acids p  0001 and 100 higher after cla p  0001 relative to the oleic acid diet conclusionssignificance high intakes of an 8020 mixture of cis9 trans11 and trans10 cis12 cla raise the total to hdl cholesterol ratio in healthy volunteers the effect of cla may be somewhat less than that of industrial trans fatty acids

wang y and s d proctor 2013 current issues surrounding the definition of transfatty acids implications for health industry and food labels british journal of nutrition 1108 13691383
the definition of transfatty acids tfa was established by the codex alimentarius to guide nutritional and legislative regulations to reduce tfa consumption currently conjugated linoleic acid cla is excluded from the tfa definition based on evidence primarily preclinical studies implying health benefits on weight management and cancer prevention while the efficacy of cla supplements remains inconsistent in randomised clinical trials evidence has emerged to associate supplemental cla with negative health outcomes including increased subclinical inflammation and oxidative stress particularly at high doses this has resulted in concerns regarding the correctness of excluding cla from the tfa definition here we review recent clinical and preclinical literature on health implications of cla and ruminant tfa and highlight several issues surrounding the current codex definition of tfa and how it may influence interpretation for public health we find that cla derived from ruminant foods differ from commercial cla supplements in their isomer compositiondistribution consumption level and bioactivity we conclude that health concerns associated with the use of supplemental cla do not repudiate the exclusion of all forms of cla from the codex tfa definition particularly when using the definition for foodrelated purposes given the emerging differential bioactivity of tfa from industrial v ruminant sources we advocate that regional nutrition guidelinespolicies should focus on eliminating industrial forms of transfat from processed foods as opposed to all tfa per se

several studies have reported a positive association between intake of trans fatty acids and risk of heart disease it has been suggested that trans fatty acids from ruminant sources are less detrimental than trans fatty acids from industrial sources legislation or advice on limiting trans fatty acids has in some instances been restricted to trans fatty acids from industrial sources however comparisons of ruminant and industrial trans fatty acids have been based on few studies using relative intake data eg quintiles of intakes therefore we have reviewed data describing the associations between absolute intake g eaten per day of ruminant and industrial trans fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease and examined the associations graphically where direct comparison is possible there are no differences in risk of coronary heart disease between total ruminant and industrial trans fatty acids for intakes up to 25 gd at higher intakes more than 3 gd total and industrial trans fatty acids are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease but there is insufficient data available on ruminant trans fatty acids at this level of intake the scarce data do not support discrimination between ruminant and industrial trans fatty acids in dietary recommendations or legislation

in the process of converting vegetable oils into solid fats a process known as partial hydrogenation some unsaturated bonds are converted to an unnatural irans position in humans trans fatty acids increase lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol in addition positive associations between intake of trans fatty acids and coronary heart disease have been observed in epidemiological studies the combined results of metabolic and epidemiological studies provide strong evidence that trans fatty acid intake is causally related to risk of coronary disease because the consumption of partially hydrogenated fats is almost universal in the united states the number of deaths attributable to such fats is likely to be substantial federal regulations should require manufacturers to include trans fatty acid content in food labels and should aim to greatly reduce or criminate the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable fats

a considerable amount of evidence has accumulated to support the view that the very long chain omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha have beneficial cardiovascular and antiinflammatory properties and that levels of their consumption are insufficient in most western diets more recently attention has been given to the possibility that the precursor omega3 pufa alpha linolenic acid alna may share some of the beneficial actions of epadha on human health further research into the metabolism and physiological actions of alna and comparisons with epadha is needed before conclusions regarding the optimal amounts and types of omega3 pufa for human health can be defined conjugated linoleic acid cla which arises as a metabolic byproduct of rumen hydrogenation and which is found in foods of animal origin has been proposed to possess potent health promoting properties but much of this research has been conducted in experimental animals there is an urgent need for complementary studies in human volunteers to confirm the putative anticarcinogenic antiatherogenic antilipogenic and immunesuppressive properties of cla

in recent years there has been a surge of interest in exploring the effect of transfatty acids tfas on biological membrane properties the research studies are motivated by an increasing body of evidence suggesting that the consumption of tfas increases the risk of developing negative health effects such as coronary heart disease and cancer the ultimate goal of studying the lipid fatty acid interactions at the molecular level is to predict the biological role of fatty acids in cells in this regard it is interesting to elucidate the effect of loading tfas and their counterpart cisfatty acids cfas on the physical properties of lipid model membranes here the present study focuses on discussing the following 1 the effect of mixing monoelaidin me tfacontaining lipid with its counterpart monoolein mo cfacontaining lipid on modulating the fully hydrated selfassembled structure and 2 the influence of solubilizing oleic acid oa and its trans counterpart elaidic acid ea on the fully hydrated me system the me model membrane was selected due to its sensitivity to variations in lipid composition and temperature synchrotron smallangle xray scattering saxs was applied for studying the temperaturedependent structural behavior of the fully hydrated memobased system prepared with an equal memo weight ratio and also for characterizing the fully hydrated oa and ealoaded me systems wideangle xray waxs experiments were also performed for characterizing the formed crystalline lamellar phases at ambient temperatures the results demonstrate the significant influence of the partial replacement of me by mo on the phase behavior the addition of mo induces the lamellarnonlamellar phase transitions at ambient temperatures and promotes the formation of the inverted type hexagonal h2 phase above 72 degrees c the fully hydrated meea and meoa systems with their rich polymorphism exhibit an interesting temperaturedependent complex behavior the experimental findings show that the temperatureinduced phase transitions are dictated by the solubilized fatty acid concentration and its configuration both ea and oa have a significant impact on the fully hydrated me system similar to previous published studies oa induces a significantly stronger mean negative membrane curvature as compared to ea the two phase diagrams are discussed in terms of water lipid and lipid fatty acid interactions membrane bending and lipid packing concepts a newly observed interesting epitaxial relationship for the lamellar hexagonal phase transition in the ealoaded me system is illustrated and discussed in detail
background the standard tables of food composition in japan do not include information on trans fatty acids previous studies estimating trans fatty acid intake among japanese have limitations regarding the databases utilized and diet assessment methodologies we developed a comprehensive database of trans fatty acid food composition and used this database to estimate intake among a japanese population methods the database was developed using analytic values from the literature and nutrient analysis software encompassing roods in the us as well as values estimated front recipes or nutrient compositions we collected 16day diet records from 225 adults aged 30 to 69 years living in 4 areas of japan trans fatty acid intake was estimated based on the database and the 16day diet records results mean total fat and trans fatty acid intake was 569 gday 277 total energy and 17 gday 08 total energy respectively for women and 668 gday 255 total energy and 17 gday 07 total energy for men trans fatty acid intake accounted for greater than 1 of total energy intake which is the maximum recommended according to the world health organization in 244 of women and 57 of men and was particularly high among women living in urban areas and those aged 3049 years the largest contributors to trans fatty acid intake were confectionaries in women and fats and oils in men conclusions although mean trans fatty acid intake was below the maximum recommended intake of the world health organization intake among subgroups was of concern further public health efforts to reduce trans fatty acid intake should be encouraged
objective we examined crosssectional associations of total hydrogenated and natural trans fatty acid intake with selected metabolic risk factors in young japanese women methods subjects were 1136 japanese female dietetic students aged 1822 years dietary intake was estimated using a validated selfadministered diet history questionnaire associations between trans fatty acid intake and metabolic risk factors were examined with multivariate linear regression analysis with control for potential covariates dietary covariates included intake of energy total fat and saturated fatty acids model 1 monounsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acids model 2 and polyunsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acids model 3 results mean standard deviation total trans fatty acid intake was 090 030 of total energy hydrogenated trans fatty acids contributed 77 of total trans fatty acid intake total trans fatty acid intake was significantly and positively associated with waist circumference triacylglycerol and glycated hemoglobin except in the analysis of triacylglycerol with adjustment for monounsaturated fatty acids no associations were found between total trans fatty acid intake and body mass index cholesterol or glucose hydrogenated trans fatty acid intake was significantly and positively associated only with waist circumference and glycated hemoglobin no association was observed for natural trans fairly acid intake conclusion hydrogenated trans fatty acid intake was positively associated with several metabolic risk factors among freeliving young japanese women with relatively low intake
background antioxidant vitamins may play a role in the prevention of stroke because they scavenge free radicals and prevent ldl oxidation epidemiologic studies that have examined this relation produced conflicting results objective we examined the association between antioxidant vitamin intakes and death from stroke design this was a prospective cohort study of 34492 postmenopausal women results during followup 215 deaths from stroke were documented total vitamin a carotenoid and vitamin e intakes were not associated with death from stroke after multivariate adjustment relative risks rrs and 95 cis of the highest compared with the lowest category were 079 045 138 p for trend  033 for vitamin a 088 045 140 p for trend  040 for carotenoids and 091 055 152 p for trend  086 for vitamin e the test for trend for total vitamin c intake was significant although the association appeared somewhat ushaped not monotonic an inverse association was seen between death from stroke and vitamin e intake from food rrs land 95 cis of death from stroke from the lowest to highest intake categories were 10 080 051 126 093 058 149 067 039 114 040 020 080 p for trend  0008 the results suggest inverse associations between death from stroke and intakes of the most concentrated vitamin e food sources consumed by this cohort mayonnaise nuts and margarine conclusions our results suggest a protective effect of vitamin e from foods on death from stroke but do not support a protective role for supplemental vitamin e or other antioxidant vitamins however given the number of deaths from stroke in the present cohort a smalltomoderate association could not be ruled out
the incidence of cardiovascular disease is well correlated with diets high in saturated fatty acids such as butter on the other hand oils which are rich in unsaturated fatty acids eg sunflower oil and corn oils reduce cholesterol synthesis and thus show protective effects against arteriosclerosis however sunflower oil and corn oil are also considered as risk factors for their sensitivities to free radical formation because of their high contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas the aim of the present study described herein was to investigate the production of reactive oxygen metabolites an indicator of oxidative stress and the activities of several transaminases markers of hepatic injury in chick liver treated with highly consumed dietary oils differing in the degree of saturation the animals were randomly assigned to six groups of 29 and fed dietary butter margarine olive oil sunflower oil or corn oil for 2 months the results indicated that the level of reactive oxygen metabolites rom was lowest in the dietary butterfed group but highest in the corn oilfed group similarly the activities of all transaminases measured were lowest in the butter group and in the margarinefed group only the gamaglutamyl transaminase activity was lowest as compared to the control group from these findings it was concluded that the dietary butter was the most resistant oil to lipid oxidation whereas corn oil was the most susceptible one which may thus challenge the antioxidant defense system and increase the susceptibility of tissues to degradation products of lipid oxidation

intake of phytosterols and stanols has been shown to decrease the level of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and thus protect against development of cardiovascular diseases therefore studies on the cultivar and yeartoyear variation in phytosterol content in rye grains have been performed the phytosterol content and composition of different rye cultivars grown under identical conditions on the same field in three consecutive years were analyzed both cultivar and yeartoyear variation in sterol content were statistically significant p  00001 the total sterol content varied from 1007  21 mgkg in the highest yielding cultivar tsulpan 3 to 761  10 mgkg in the lowest yielding cultivar amando in the 1999 harvest because the meteorological conditions varied substantially between the different years it was possible to deduce the impact of varying weather conditions on phytosterol content in the different cultivars the studied cultivars had all the lowest phytosterol contents in the dry and warm harvest season of 1999 although there were statistically significant cultivar and yeartoyear variations in the sterol composition p  00001 these were only between 2 and 4 of the total sterol content
the present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that trans fatty acids can induce apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvec to test this hypothesis apoptosis was measured in huvec treated with 01 10 or 50 mm trans elaidic acid t181 or linoelaidic acid tt182 for 24 hours for the detection of apoptosis tdtmediated dutp nick end labelling assay tunel cell binding of annexin v and propidium iodide uptake were measured active caspase3 and cleaved parp polyadpribose polymerase were also measured in the cell lysate moreover cellular ability to produce ros reactive oxygen species was measured by dcf fluorescence both acids studied induce both early annexinpositive cells and late stages of apoptosis cells stained by propidium iodide in a dosedependent manner also the appearance of tunelpositive cells was induced by both trans fatty acids tested in a dose dependent manner both trans acids induce apoptosis through their effect on caspase3 activity and on intracellular ros production it is worth emphasising that linoelaidic acid proved to be a more potent inducer of apoptosis and ros production in endothelial cells than elaidic acid the present studies suggest that trans fatty acids may play a role in damaging and death of vascular endothelial cells in atherosclerosis

fat is generally a highly valued element of the diet to provide energy palatability to dry foods or to serve as a cooking medium however some foods rich in fat have a low fat quality with respect to nutrition ie a relative high content of saturated sfa as compared to unsaturated fatty acids whereas others have a more desirable fat quality ie a relative high content of unsaturated fatty acids as compared to sfa highfat dairy products and fatty meats are examples of foods with low fat quality whereas vegetable oils tropical oils such as palm and coconut oil excluded are products with a generally high fat quality the aim of this paper is to explore the nutritional impact of products made of vegetable oils e g margarines and dressings and how they can be designed to contribute to good health since their first industrial production the food industry has endeavored to improve products like margarines including their nutritional characteristics with evolving nutrition science margarines and cooking products and to a lesser extent dressings have been adapted to contain less trans fatty acids tfa less sfa and more essential polyunsaturated pufa fatty acids this has been possible by using careful fat and oil selection and modification processes by blending vegetable oils rich in the essential pufas alphalinolenic acid vegetable omega3 or linoleic acid omega6 margarines and dressings with both essential fatty acids present in significant quantities can be realized in addition full hydrogenation and fat rearrangement have enabled the production of costeffective margarines virtually devoid of tfa and low in sfa dietary surveys indicate that vegetable oils soft margarines and dressings are indeed often important sources of essential fatty acids in peoples diets whilst providing negligible amounts of tfa and contributing modestly to sfa intakes based on empirical and epidemiological data the public health benefit of switching from products with a low fat quality to products with a high fat quality can be predicted for example switching from butter or palm oil to a soft margarine shows a substantial improvement in the nutritional quality of the diet these simple practical dietary adaptations can be expected to contribute to the healthy growth and development of children and to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease copyright c 2009 s karger ag basel

intake of trans fatty acids unfavorably affects blood lipoproteins as margarines are a major source of trans claims for the advantages of margarines over butter need to be scrutinized here we review dietary trials that directly compared the effects of butter and margarine on blood lipids we identified 20 studies in which subjects had stable body weights and margarine and butter were exchanged in the diet at constant energy and far intake we calculated the chan in average blood lipid levels between study diets 49 comparisons as a function of the percentage of calories as margarine substituted for butter replacing 10 of calories from butter by hard hightrans stick margarines lowered total serum cholesterol by 019 ldl by 011 and hdl by 002 mmoll and did not affect the totalhdl cholesterol ratio soft lowtrans tub margarines decreased total cholesterol by 025 and ldl by 020 mmoll did not affect hdl and decreased the totalhdl cholesterol ratio by 020 based on the totalhdl cholesterol ratio replacement of 30 g of butter per day by soft tub margarines would theoretically predict a reduction in coronary heart disease risk of 10 while replacement of butter by hard hightrans margarines would have no effect replacing butter by lowtrans soft margarines favorably affects the blood lipoprotein profile and may reduce the predicted risk of coronary heart disease but hightrans hard margarines probably confer no benefit over butter c 1997 elsevier science ireland ltd

most dietary fatty acids contain at least one double bond which is usually in the cis configuration however biohydrogenation in the rumen of cows and sheep or catalytic hydrogenation of vegetable oils in the food industries will convert some of the cia double bonds to the trans configuration trans fatty acid intake in western europe and north america probably ranges from 5 to 15 gday major dietary sources are frying fats used in industrial food preparation margarines and other spreads in the past margarines contained up to 50 trans fatty acids however these are now being phased out trans fatty acids raise serum low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and lower high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol in humans when substituted for cis unsaturated fatty acids in the diet these effects may be mediated by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein trans fatty acids also increase lipoprotein a levels relative to other fatty acids the effects of trans fatty acids on the risk profile for coronary heart disease are thus unfavorable and labels of food products should state the trans fatty acid content
background experimental studies suggest that elevated de novo lipogenesis dnl might be involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders few prospective studies have been conducted especially among populations with a high carbohydrate intake to determine whether dnl fatty acids are associated with the risk of the metabolic syndrome mets objective we aimed to investigate associations of erythrocyte fatty acids in the dnl pathwayincluding myristic acid 140 palmitic acid 160 palmitoleic acid 161n7 hexadecenoic acid 161n9 stearic acid 180 vaccenic acid 181n7 and oleic acid 18 1n9with the risk of mets in a chinese population with an average carbohydrate intake of 60 of energy design a total of 1176 freeliving chinese men and women aged 5070 y from beijing and shanghai were included in our analysis giving rise to 412 incident mets cases during 6 y of followup erythrocyte fatty acids and metabolic traits were measured in these participants results erythrocyte fatty acids in the dnl pathway were correlated with a high ratio of carbohydratetofat intake less favorable lipid profiles and elevated liver enzymes at baseline in comparison with the lowest quartile rrs 95 cis of mets in the highest quartile were 130 104 162 ptrend  0007 for 161n7 148 117 186 ptrend  0001 for 161n9 126 101 156 ptrend  006 for 181n7 and 151 119 192 ptrend  0001 for 181n9 after multivariate adjustment for lifestyle factors and body mass index moreover 160 and 161n7 were associated with an elevated risk of diabetes conclusion our findings suggest that fatty acids in the dnl pathway are independently associated with an elevated risk of metabolic disorders
