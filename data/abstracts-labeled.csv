Trans fatty acids, like saturated fatty acids, raise LDL cholesterol levels in the blood, thereby increasing the risk of coronary heart disease. The panel concluded that at equivalent dietary levels, the effect of trans fatty acids on heart health may be greater than that of saturated fatty acids. However, current intakes of trans fatty acids are generally more than 10-fold lower than those of saturated fatty acids whose intakes in many European countries exceed dietary recommendations. The NDA panel also evaluated other health effects and concluded that scientific evidence with regards to a possible relationship of trans fatty acid intake with cancer, type 2 diabetes or allergies is weak or inconsistent. Finally, the panel advised that there are no analytical methods available to distinguish between trans fatty acids from natural sources and those formed during food processing.""Abilleira, E., et al.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 57(11): 4746-4753."	0	"Typically, two different flock managements are employed by basque sheepherders in winter and spring. Thus, seasonal changes in the fatty acid (FA) composition of Idiazabal PDO farmhouse cheeses were studied. Ewe's raw milk cheeses elaborated in winter and spring were collected after 120 days of ripening from 10 Idiazabal PDO farmhouses. In winter, concentrate and conserved forages were fed, whereas a part-time grazing system was adopted from spring onward. Spring cheeses had less (P <= 0.05) saturated FA and higher (P <= 0.05) content of unsaturated FA, including trans-FA (mainly trans-vaccenic acid) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), branched-chain FA (BCFA), and n-3 FA. Principal component analysis (PCA) separated winter and spring cheeses into two groups by the combination of two principal components (84.2% of variance). Fresh pasture in the diet enhanced desirable FA and lowered atherogenicity index in cheeses, supporting the benefits of using a part-time grazing system for the consumer.""Abraham, R. A., et al.

In this cross-sectional study, fatty acid in adipose tissue, cheek epithelium, and blood samples were assessed by gas chromatography. Spearman correlation coefficient was computed to study the correlation of fatty acid distribution among the three tissues. The correlation coefficient of total trans fatty acid between cheek epithelium and serum was 0.30(0.02) and between cheek epitheliumand adipose tissue was 0.33 (P< 0.019). This study is the first to report trans fatty acid profile in cheek epithelium giving scope for utilizing the cheek epithelium as a tissue for objective assessment of trans fatty acid intake.""AbuMweis, S.

The cholesterol-lowering action of plant sterols, when provided in a fish-oil fatty acids vehicle, remains to be investigated in humans. A randomized, crossover-feeding, single-blind trial was conducted in 30 subjects with mild-to-mode rate hypercholesterolemia to study the effects on plasma lipids of 2 novel forms of plant sterols: those combined with, or esterified to, fish-oil fatty acids. The treatments were margarine (control), free plant sterols, plant sterols esterified to fatty acids from sunflower oil, plant sterols esterified to very long-chained fatty acids from fish oil, and plant sterols combined with the same amount of very long-chained fatty acids from fish oil. Each sterol-containing food (1.0-1.8 g plantsterols/d) was consumed for 29 das a single dose with breakfast under staff supervision. Compared with the control treatment, none of the plant sterol preparations reduced plasma total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), or C-reactive protein concentration. Relative to the control phase, all plant sterols treatment increased the plasma HDL cholesterol concentration (P < 0.05) by similar to 8%. In conclusion, because standard forms of plant sterols did not reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations, the efficacy of the new formulation of plant sterols cannot be confirmed from the present study design, where plant sterols were given as a single morning dose.""Acar, N., et al.

Method: The rats which were fed for two weeks by the same diet were separated into experimental and control groups. Fifty mg/day trans-9 18: 1 octadecenoic acid isomer was added to the diet of experimental group for 10 days. Following the completion of special diet, fatty acid composition in both groups was studied by gas chromatography analysis. Results: Trans-9 18: 1 fatty acid level in the experimental group was higher than control group (p<0.01). The soluble cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1) increased (p<0.01) and IGF-1 levels decreased (p<0.05) in rats fed with trans-9 18: 1 octadecenoic acid. Conclusion: Our results indicate that, high levels of dietary trans fatty acid isomers are a factor in the increasing of cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1) levels and decreasing of IGF-1 levels. Hence, measurement of these parameters may be beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis, as well as in other pathological cases. We believe that these parameters may also be useful for early diagnosis.""Alavian, S. M., et al. (2008).

This national survey was conducted on 4811 representative school-students. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the HW phenotype for abnormal anthropometric and biochemical factors by using receiver operator characteristic curves. We determined the association of dietary patterns (obtained by factor analysis), physical activity level and some environmental factors with the HW phenotype. Overall, 8.52% of participants had the HW phenotype. Those children with the HW phenotype were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, notably for overweight and hypercholesterolemia. The dietary pattern characterized by junk foods increased the odds of having the HW phenotype, OR = 1.426 (95% CI, 1.109, 1.892), whereas the other dietary pattern including healthy foods decreased this odds, OR = 0.874 (95% CI, 0.765, 0.998). The risk of the HW phenotype rose with the consumption of solid hydrogenated fat as well as white-flour bread. Low education of parents and a positive family history of diabetes mellitus, obesity and or premature cardiovascular disease were the other risk factors for the HW phenotype. Low levels of physical activity significantly increased the risk of having the HW phenotype. The HW phenotype can be used as an accurate and easy tool for screening children at metabolic risk in population-based studies.""Alcalde, S. M., et al. (2014). ""TRANS FATTY ACID CONTENT IN FOODS MARKETED IN THE COMMUNITY OF MADRID (SPAIN)."" Nutricion Hospitalaria 29(1): 180-186."	0	"Introduction: As a consequence of the scientific evidence which show that the high consumption of trans fatty acids is a risk factor of certain illnesses, sanitary authorities recommend less than 1% intake of trans fatty acids of the total energy intake. Moreover, the European Commission must present, by December 2014, a report about the presence of trans fatty acids in the aliments as well as in the diet of the European Union population. Thus, this study can provide useful information to reach this objective. Objectives: To determine trans fatty acid presence in some types of foods in the Community of Madrid. Methods: 170 samples of different foods commonly consumed by children and adolescents were selected and analized. All foods had been purchased in big shopping centers in the Community of Madrid during february of 2010. Results are shown as the percentage of each fatty acid compared to the total amount of fat in the aliment. Results: Only 33 products (19.4%) showed the presence of trans fatty acids over the method detection limit (>= 0.1g per 100g). The highest levels were found in dairy products, with an average content of 0,4%. Discusion/conclusiones: The trans fatty acid content of the analyzed foods can be considered low, compared with the amount reported by other authors in food products marketed in Spain and other countries in the past few years. Further studies should be undertaken to control nutrition security and diet quality of fat intake in the Spanish population, particularly among children and adolescents.""Aldamiz-Echevarria, L., et al.

Pediatric Nephrology 19(9): 1039-1045."	2	"Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in recipients of renal transplants. Although the risk for cardiovascular disease is in part genetically determined, it may also be influenced by diet. The aim of the present study was to analyze the cross-sectional association of dietary intake of nutrients with biochemical markers of atherogenic risk. The influence of diet on the plasma profile of fatty acids was specifically investigated. Twenty-nine children and adolescents (mean age 14 years, range 6-18 years) with stable renal transplants and on a normal diet recorded their food intake for a period of 3 days. The mean calorie intake was 40.6 kcal/kg per day (protein provided 16% of total calories, carbohydrates 45%, and fat 39%). Plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were significantly and positively related to intake of monounsaturated fatty acids ( r =0.66, P =0.007 and r =0.62, P =0.02, respectively) and to plasma levels of elaidic acid, a trans fatty acid ( r =0.43, P =0.02 and r =0.54, P =0.01, respectively). Insulin resistance, estimated from values of plasma glucose ( r =0.70, P =0.03), plasma insulin ( r =0.59, P =0.02), and HOMA index ( r =0.62, P =0.01), was also directly related to the intake of monounsaturated fatty acids. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity correlated positively with total fat intake ( r =0.59, P =0.04). Plasma levels of homocysteine were negatively related to the intake of carbohydrates ( r =-0.62, P =0.02). We conclude that reasonable dietary recommendations to minimize the atherogenic risk in children with stable renal transplants should include a protein intake adjusted to the requirements for age, a large intake of carbohydrates leading to a low glycemic load, and a fat intake of less than 30% of the total calorie intake. The amount of monounsaturated and trans fatty acids in the diet should be especially limited. A sufficient intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, with an adequate ratio between omega6 and omega3 components, should also be provided.""Alhassan, S., et al. (2006).

In a stratified double-blind manner, participants were randomly assigned to either a PSE (n = 17) or a placebo (CON, n = 9) margarine group. Participants supplemented their daily diets with 42 g of margarine spread (PSE = 3 g; CON, PSE = 0 g, of approximately equal energy content) for 9 weeks. During the last 4 weeks of margarine supplementation (MS), participants expended 400 kcal on a treadmill 5 d/wk at 65% of <(V)over dot > O-2 reserve (2000 kcal/wk). Fasting blood samples were obtained before initiating and after 4 weeks of MS and after exercise training. All blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and cholesterol ester transfer protein activities. Total cholesterol (-10%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-13%). and triglyceride (-18%) concentrations decreased after 4 weeks of MS in the PSE group, but not in the CON group (P < .05 for all). Four weeks of aerobic exercise increased HDL-C by 21% in the CON group (P < .05) and by 4% in the PSE group (P > .05). Total cholesterol-HDL-C ratio decreased significantly (P < .05) in the PSE group, but not in the CON group. No other significant alterations were observed with either PSE or exercise. Our findings suggest that PSE is effective in reducing blood cholesterol concentrations and that exercise can increase HDL-C in middle-aged men and postmenopausal Women. Our findings also suggest that PSE supplementation may attenuate the exercise-induced increase in HDL-C. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.""Ali, L. H., et al. (1997).

Design Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups. The study design was an ABB/BAA extra-period crossover. One group consumed a diet rich in saturated fatty acid (SFA) with fat making up 20.8% of total energy, for 5 weeks and then one rich in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), with fat making up 20.3% of total energy for 10 weeks. The other group consumed the MUFA diet for 5 weeks followed by the SFA diet for 10 weeks. Subjects/setting Men and women aged 35 to 69 years who were nonsmokers with no chronic illness and not on any medication were recruited to participate. Eighteen subjects were recruited and 15 (5 men, 10 women) completed the community-based study. Intervention Blood was sampled at the beginning and end point of each 5-week diet period for analysis of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors and blood lipids. Subjects kept 3-day food diaries twice during each of the three diet periods and were weighed on each visit for blood collection. Analysis of plasma fatty acids was used to indicate dietary compliance. Main outcome measures Differences in fasting factor VIIc, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A-1 and B, and plasma oleic acid levels while receiving the SFA diet vs MUFA diet. Statistical analysis A general linear model allowing for the ABB/BAA extra-period crossover, was used for each of the outcome measures. Results Factor VIIc was lower on the MUFA diet (P < .05) but fibrinogen and insulin concentrations and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity did not differ between diets. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .001) and triglyceride (P < .01) levels were lower on the MUFA diet compared with the SFA diet.

The three test margarines, which contributed 78% of total fat in the diets, were produced from 70% of butterfat, PHSO, or PHFO, each with 30% of soybean oil. Fat provided about 35% of energy, and trans fatty acids 0.9%, 8.5%, and 8.0% of energy in the butter-, the PHSO-, and the PHFO-diet, respectively. Dietary cholesterol was balanced by the addition of dried egg powder to the PHSO-and the butter-diet; thus all diets contained 420 mg dietary cholesterol per 10 MJ per day. The subjects consumed all three test diets for 19-21 days in a random order (crossover design). The serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol were significantly elevated on the PHFO-diet (mean values 5.42 and 3.94 mmol/L, respectively) compared to the PHSO-diet (5.11 and 3.58 mmol/L, respectively) but not different from those on the butter-diet (5.32 and 3.81 mmol/L, respectively). LDL-cholesterol was significantly reduced on the PHSO-diet compared to the butter-diet. The level of HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower on the PHFO-diet (0.98 mmol/L) when compared to the butter-diet (1.05 mmol/L) and with border-line significance compared to the PHSO-diet (1.05 mmol/L).

No significant differences in triglyceride values were observed. Lp[a] increased and apoA-I decreased significantly after consumption of both the PHSO-diet and the PHFO-diet, compared to the butter-diet. In conclusion, our results indicate that consumption of PHFO may unfavorably affect lipid risk indicators for coronary heart disease at least to the same extent as butterfat.

Objective: We studied the effect of SE-enriched spread on serum lipids, lipoproteins, carotenoids, fat-soluble vitamins, and physiologic variables in children with FH aged 7-12 y. Design: In a randomized, double-blind crossover study comprising two 8-wk interventions, 38 children with FH consumed 18.2 +/- 1.5 g SE spread/d, corresponding to 1.60 +/- 0.13 g SEs, or a control spread. Blood samples were analyzed at the start and end of each diet period. Results: Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased by 10.2% (P = 0.003) during the SE period compared with the control period. Total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations were reduced by 7.4% (P = 0.007 and P = 0.020, respectively) during the SE period. No changes were observed in HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, or apolipoprotein A-I. Serum concentration of lipid-adjusted lycopene decreased by 8.1 % (P = 0.015) in the SE period, with no changes in the other carotenoids. Lipid-adjusted retinol and a-tocopherol concentrations increased by 15.6% (P < 0.001) and 7.1 % (P = 0.027), respectively. There was an increase (16.8%, P = 0.04) in alanine transaminase in the SE period, but this was explained by a significantly lower starting concentration in the SE period than in the control period. The children consumed a recommended American Heart Association Step I diet during both intervention periods. Conclusion: A daily intake of 1.6 g SEs induces an additional reduction in LDL-cholesterol concentrations in children with FH consuming a recommended diet.""Anadon, A., et al. (2011).

Comparisons were established with a third group of rats (control) which did not receive fat administration. Both fats were well tolerated, and no adverse events or mortality were observed during the treatment nor after a 2-week observation period. EDF and SDF did not cause significant differences with respect to a control group in body weight gain, food consumption, clinical observations, organ weight ratios, histopathological findings and most of the hematological and biochemical parameters including total cholesterol and cholesterol fractions in plasma. In rats treated with SDF, a significant increase of triglycerides was observed as compared to the control group. By contrast, in rats treated with EDF, a significant decrease in triglycerides was detected. EDF orally administered to rats was safe, and no treatment-related toxicity was detected.

To investigate the association between trans fatty acid and adiposity, 96 mother-infant pairs (exclusive breastfed; mixed fed; and formula fed) at 3 months postpartum were interviewed; body composition was measured onsite using the BOD POD and PEA POD for mothers and infants, respectively. Subjects/Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling from Athens-Clarke and surrounding counties of the state of Georgia. Data were analyzed using chi(2), analysis of variance and regression. Results: There were no significant differences in maternal percent body fat by feeding group (32.70, 33.70, and 35.73%, for exclusive, mixed and formula feeding, respectively). Exclusively breastfed infants had higher percent body fat (24.87%) compared with their mixed-fed counterparts (22.15%) but not formula-fed infants (23.93). Mothers who consumed at least 4.5 g of trans fatty acids/day were 5.8 times more likely to have body fat >= 30% than those consuming less (odds ratio = 5.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05, 32.32), and their infants were over two times more likely (odds ratio = 2.13; 95% CI, 0.75, 6.01) to have body fat >= 24%. Conclusions: Trans fatty acid content of the maternal diet may be associated with both maternal and infant body composition in the early postpartum period.

Agro Food Industry Hi-Tech 22(5): 10-12."	0	"This paper examines the effect of maternal intake of industrially produced trans fatty acid (elaidic acid) on the health of the fetus, pregnancy outcome, and risk of adiposity in early postpartum period. The evidence suggests that mothers who consume higher trans fatty acids during pregnancy may have an increased risk for negative pregnancy outcomes, such as small-for-gestational age, low birth weight and preterm delivery. In addition, breastfed infants of mothers with high trans fatty acid intake may have greater adiposity in the early postpartum period and have increased concentration of inflammatory markers, such as C-Reactive Protein, in their plasma, which may contribute to increased risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease later in life. A reduction in industrially produced trans fatty acid (elaidic acid) consumption by pregnant and nursing mothers may lead to improved pregnancy and infant health outcomes.""Ando, A., et al. (2009).

A total of 550 strains of fungi and yeasts were screened for CLA production from t-VA through Delta 9 desaturation. Delacroixia coronata IFO 8586 was selected as a potent producer of CLA from t-VA. Efficient CLA production was observed during cultivation in medium supplemented with the methyl ester of t-VA (t-VAME). Under the optimal conditions with 33.3 mg ml(-1) of t-VAME as substrate, 10.5 mg ml(-1) CLA was produced by D. coronata IFO 8586 after 7 days of cultivation in the medium containing dextrin (5.0%), tryptone (2.0%) and thiourea (0.83 mu mol ml(-1)). The strain produced the cis-9,trans-11 isomer of CLA selectively (98% of total CLA), with a small amount of the trans-9,trans-11 isomer (2% of total CLA), mainly in the form of triacylglycerols (69% of total CLA). A practical bio-process for selective production of cis-9,trans-11 isomer of CLA using filamentous fungus D. coronata IFO 8586 was successfully established. Isomer selective bio-process for the practical production of cis-9,trans-11-CLA was first established. The process is benefitable for expanding the application of CLA for medicinal and nutraceutical purposes.""Andrushko, N., et al. (2010).

Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research 45(7): 625-631."	1	"High saturated and trans fatty acid intake, the typical dietary pattern of Western populations, favors a proinflammatory status that contributes to generating insulin resistance (IR). We examined whether the consumption of these fatty acids was associated with IR and inflammatory markers. In this cross-sectional study, 127 non-diabetic individuals were allocated to a group without IR and 56 to another with IR, defined as homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) >2.71. Diet was assessed using 24-h food recalls. Multiple linear regression was employed to test independent associations with HOMA-IR. The IR group presented worse anthropometric, biochemical and inflammatory profiles. Energy intake was correlated with abdominal circumference and inversely with adiponectin concentrations (r = -0.227, P = 0.002), while saturated fat intake correlated with inflammatory markers and trans fat with HOMA-IR (r = 0.160, P = 0.030). Abdominal circumference was associated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.430, P < 0.001). In multiple analysis, HOMA-IR remained associated with trans fat intake (beta = 1.416, P = 0.039) and body mass index (beta = 0.390, P < 0.001), and was also inversely associated with adiponectin (beta = -1.637, P = 0.004). Inclusion of other nutrients (saturated fat and added sugar) or other inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) into the models did not modify these associations. Our study supports that trans fat intake impairs insulin sensitivity. The hypothesis that its effect could depend on transcription factors, resulting in expression of proinflammatory genes, was not corroborated. We speculate that trans fat interferes predominantly with insulin signaling via intracellular kinases, which alter insulin receptor substrates.""Angell, S. Y., et al. (2012). ""Change in Trans Fatty Acid Content of Fast-Food Purchases Associated With New York City's Restaurant Regulation A Pre-Post Study."" Annals of Internal Medicine 157(2): 81-+."	1	"Background: Dietary trans fat increases risk for coronary heart disease. In 2006, New York City (NYC) passed the first regulation in the United States restricting trans fat use in restaurants. Objective: To assess the effect of the NYC regulation on the trans and saturated fat content of fast-food purchases. Design: Cross-sectional study that included purchase receipts matched to available nutritional information and brief surveys of adult lunchtime restaurant customers conducted in 2007 and 2009, before and after implementation of the regulation. Setting: 168 randomly selected NYC restaurant locations of 11 fast-food chains. Participants: Adult restaurant customers interviewed in 2007 and 2009. Measurements: Change in mean grams of trans fat, saturated fat, trans plus saturated fat, and trans fat per 1000 kcal per purchase, overall and by chain type. Results: The final sample included 6969 purchases in 2007 and 7885 purchases in 2009. Overall, mean trans fat per purchase decreased by 2.4 g (95% CI, -2.8 to -2.0 g; P < 0.001), whereas saturated fat showed a slight increase of 0.55 g (CI, 0.1 to 1.0 g; P = 0.011). Mean trans plus saturated fat content decreased by 1.9 g overall (CI, -2.5 to -1.2 g; P < 0.001). Mean trans fat per 1000 kcal decreased by 2.7 g per 1000 kcal (CI, -3.1 to -2.3 g per 1000 kcal; P < 0.001). Purchases with zero grams of trans fat increased from 32% to 59%. In a multivariate analysis, the poverty rate of the neighborhood in which the restaurant was located was not associated with changes. Limitation: Fast-food restaurants that were included may not be representative of all NYC restaurants. Conclusion: The introduction of a local restaurant regulation was associated with a substantial and statistically significant decrease in the trans fat content of purchases at fast-food chains, without a commensurate increase in saturated fat. Restaurant patrons from high-and low-poverty neighborhoods benefited equally. However, federal regulation will be necessary to fully eliminate population exposure to industrial trans fat sources.""Anselmi, C. V., et al. (2010).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate different fatty acid profile between AF/AFL subjects and healthy controls. Methods Gas chromatography was employed to determine fatty acid percentage of erythrocyte membranes from 40 idiopathic AFL/AF patients and 53 healthy control subjects. Results AFL/AF erythrocyte membranes had significantly lower percentage of saturated fatty acid (43.1 +/- SD2.2 versus 47.8 +/- SD9.6, p<0.001), monounsaturated fatty acid (18.2 +/- SD2.5 versus 22.6 +/- SD5.2, p<0.001) and total trans fatty acid (0.2 +/- SD0.1 vs 1.3 +/- SD1.1, p<0.001) than controls. Furthermore, fatty acid (FA) profiles of arrhythmic individuals showed an increased percent of total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (36.7 +/- SD2.4 versus 26.4 +/- SD10.4, p<0.001), PUFA n-3 (5.3 +/- SD1.1 versus 2.8 +/- SD1.8, p<0.001) and n-6 (31.4 +/- SD2.2 versus 23.5 +/- SD9.9, p<0.001).

A randomized, double blind dietary intervention trial was carried out with healthy male volunteers (n=88) in three European centers. After a 6-week washout period where subjects avoided foods containing all trans fats, subjects either continued for 6 weeks with a low trans diet or a diet where trans alpha -linolenic acid provided 0.6% of energy (supplied as oil, margarine, cheese, muffins, and biscuits). At the end of the washout period the intake of trans polyunsaturated fats was 58+/-115 mg/day; this increased in patients on the high trans diet by +1344+/-328 mg/day, compared with +10+/-67 mg/day in patients on the low trans diet (p<0.01). The change in trans a-linolenic acid in plasma cholesteryl eaters was 0.26+/-0.20 on the high trans and 0.00+/-0.07% of fatty acids on the low trans diet (p<0.001). No effect of the high trans diet was observed on platelet aggregation: collagen ECS, high trans 157+/-100, low trans 152+/-90 ng/mL (NS); U44619 EC50 high trans 81+/-61, low trans 59+/-27 nM (NS). The high trans diet did not affect platelet thromboxane production, fibrinogen levels, factor VII, activated factor VIIa, or plasminogen activator inhibitor activity. There were no center-specific differences in response to the high traits diet. A relatively high amount of trans or-linolenic acid for 6 weeks does not increase the risk of coronary heart disease by promoting platelet aggregation and blood coagulation.

Recent multi-center studies from Europe indicate that the average intake of trans fatty acids is reasonably low, and represents between 0.5 and 2.0% of the caloric intake In these amounts, trans fatty acids do not appear to have an affect on the risk of coronary heart disease. A considerably higher intake of trans fatty acids may be associated with a moderately increased risk of CHD, as suggested by a prospective cohort study from Finland Trans fatty acids from animal fats comprise 35 to 70% of trans fatty acid intake in Europe. Their effects have not been studied separately but it is known that the metabolism of the main trans isomer of animal fat, lit vaccenic acid, differs from the main isomers of partially hydrogenated vegetable and fish oils. In Mediterranean countries the consumption of both saturated and trans fatty acids is moderate and the risk of CHD is low. However, in central and northern European countries, the consumption of saturated fatty acids is ten-fold (12 to 18%) compared with that of trans fatty acids (1 to 2%). Further benefits can be achieved by reducing the consumption of foods high in C12-16 saturated fatty acids instead of focussing on trans fatty acids alone (C)1998, Medikal Press.""Aro, A., et al.

Dietary trans fatty acid intake in reflected in the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue. In an international multicentre study in eight European countries and Israel (EURAMIC), adipose tissue aspiration samples were obtained from 671 men with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), aged 70 years or less, and 717 men without a history of AMI (controls). The proportion of fatty acids, including isomeric trans monoenoic fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms (C18:1), was determined by gas chromatography. Although there were considerable differences between countries in mean (SD) proportion of adipose tissue C18:1 trans fatty acids, there was no overall difference between cases (1.61 [0.92]%) and the controls (1.57 [0.86]%). The risk of AMI did not differ significantly from 1.0 over quartiles of adipose C18:1 trans fatty acids: the multivariate odds ratio was 0.97 (95% CI 0.56-1.67) for the highest versus lowest quartile. After exclusion of subjects from Spanish centres because they had far lower proportions of adipose trans fatty acids than subjects from other countries, there was a tendency to increased risk of AMI in the upper quartiles of C18:1 trans; however, the trend was not statistically significant. Our results reflect considerable differences between countries in dietary intake of trans fatty acids but do not suggest a major overall effect of C18:1 trans fatty acids on risk of AMI. We cannot exclude the possibility that trans fatty acids have a significant impact on risk of AMI in populations with high intake.""Aro, A., et al. (1997).

All diets provided 32.2-33.9% of energy as fat, 14.6-15.8% as saturated plus trans fatty acids, 11.4-12.5% as cis-monounsaturated fatty acids, 2.9-3.5% as polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 200-221 mg cholesterol/10 MJ. Compared with the dairy fat diet, stearic acid and trans fatty acids decreased serum total cholesterol concentrations similarly (by 13% and 12%, respectively, P < 0.001) but the trans fatty acid diet decreased HDL cholesterol (17%) and apolipoprotein (ape) A-I (15%) significantly more than did the stearic acid diet (11% and 12%, respectively). Stearic acid but not trans fatty acids reduced concentrations of LDL cholesterol and apo B significantly (P < 0.001). The trans fatty acid diet increased the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol (19%) and of apo B to apo A-I (16%) more than did the dairy fat diet (P < 0.001) but the stearic acid diet had no effect. Lipoprotein(a) concentrations increased with both experimental diets, significantly more with trans fatty acids (30%) than with stearic acid (10%). In conclusion, high amounts of trans fatty acids had more adverse effects on lipoproteins than did equal amounts of stearic acid and dairy fat. Stearic acid reduced LDL cholesterol, did not affect the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol, and increased lipoprotein(a), although to a lesser extent than did trans fatty acids. Dietary fats low in both saturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids should be favored.""Aryana, K. J. (2007).

When a mixture of TFA isomers obtained by partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils is used to replace oleic acid, there is a dose-dependent increase in the LDL:HDL ratio. The relationship between amount of TFA as % of energy and the increase in the LDL:HDL ratio appears to be approximately linear, with no evidence of a threshold at low levels of intake, and with slope twice as steep as that observed by replacing oleic with saturated fats. The average impact of TFA induced changes in the LDL:HDL ratio correspond to tens of thousands premature deaths in the US alone. Although dramatic, this effect is substantially smaller than the increase in cardiovascular mortality associated with TFA intake in epidemiological studies, suggesting that other mechanisms are likely to contribute to the toxicity of TFA.

American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 66: S1006-S1010."	2	"trans Fatty acids are formed during the process of partial hydrogenation in which liquid vegetable oils are converted to margarine and vegetable shortening. Concern has existed that this process may have adverse consequences because natural essential fatty acids are destroyed and the new artificial isomers are structurally similar to saturated fats, lack the essential metabolic activity of the parent compounds, and inhibit the enzymatic desaturation of linoleic and linolenic acid. In the past 5 y a series of metabolic studies has provided unequivocal evidence that trans fatty acids increase plasma concentrations of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and reduce concentrations of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol relative to the parent natural fat. In these same studies, trans fatty acids increased the plasma ratio of total to HDL cholesterol nearly twofold compared with saturated fats. On the basis of these metabolic effects and the known relation of blood lipid concentrations to risk of coronary artery disease, we estimate conservatively that 30 000 premature deaths/y in the United States are attributable to consumption of trans fatty acids. Epidemiologic studies, although not conclusive on their own, are consistent with adverse effects of this magnitude or even larger. Because there are no known nutritional benefits of trans fatty acids and clear adverse metabolic consequences exist. prudent public policy would dictate that their consumption be minimized and that information on the trans fatty acid content of foods be available to consumers.""Ascherio, A., et al.

Intake of trans-fatty acids was estimated using a previously validated food frequency questionnaire. After adjustment for age, sex, and energy intake, intake of trans-fatty acids was directly related to risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk for highest compared with lowest quintile, 2.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.42, 4.19; for trend P<.0001). This relation remained highly significant after adjustment for established coronary risk factors, multivitamin use, and intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, linoleic acid, dietary cholesterol, vitamins E and C, carotene, and fiber. Intake of margarine-the major source of trans-isomers-was significantly associated with risk of myocardial infarction.

The aim of this study was to quantify the amounts of common fatty acids in several fast foods in Iran, with specific focus on TFAs. The most commonly consumed fast foods in Iran: sausage, calbas, hamburgers and pizzas, were randomly selected seven times from products available in supermarkets and restaurants. Each time a 10 g sample was drawn and prepared for fatty acid analysis. Total and individual fatty acids were quantified according to standard methods by gas chromatography with 60 meter capillary column and flame ionization detector. The most common saturated fatty acids in Iranian fast foods is stearic acid (C18:0) which ranged from 14.0% to 20.9%. Saturated fatty acid content in calbas was significantly higher than that found in other groups. Trans fatty acids constitute almost 23.6% to 30.6% of total fatty acids of these products. The most common TFA in these fast foods was elaidic acid (C18:1 9t). Total cis unsaturated fatty acid content of tested fast foods varied from 25.3 %( in sausage) to 46.8(in calbas) with oleic acid (C18:1 9c) followed by linoleic acid (C18:2) being the most common fatty acids in these products.

Use of plant stanols decreases low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. We compared the effects of the Mediterranean diet and plant stanol esters on vascular risk factors and estimated CVD (eCVD) risk. Methods and results: In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 150 mildly hypercholesterolaemic subjects were randomized to Mediterranean diet, a spread containing plant stanol esters (2 g/day) or a placebo spread. Vascular risk factors were assessed every month for 4 months and the eCVD risk was calculated using the PROspective- Cardiovascular-Munster (PROCAM), Framingham, and Reynolds risk engines. Placebo had no significant effect on risk factors or eCVD risk. Mediterranean diet gradually induced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, triglycerides, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), blood pressure and eCVD risk (24-32%). The plant stanol ester spread reduced (by 1 month) TC (-14%), LDL-C (-16%), hsCRP (-17%), and estimated CVD risk (26-30%). eCVD risk reduction was sustained at 4th months when the gradual Mediterranean diet eCVD risk reduction became comparable to that of the stanol group. Conclusions: Plant stanol esters yielded an early, by 1st treatment month, reduction of eCVD risk that resulted from a TC, LDL-C, and hsCRP decrease. eCVD risk reduction on the Mediterranean diet resulted from a change in several CVD risk factors and equaled that of plant stanol at 4 months. The consumption of plant stanol esters by moderately hypercholesterolaemic patients may be a useful option to reduce CVD risk in those who do not adopt a Mediterranean diet. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Design: Observational study. Methods: Milk samples were collected from 52 lactating mothers aging 19-39y, from Western Iran. Subjects were asked to complete a diet questionnaire. Milk fatty acids were measured as 2-nitrophenylhydrazide derivatives by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Saturated fatty acids were the main fraction of human milk (41.3%). Medium-chain fatty acids (C8:0-C14:0) constituted 24%, oleic acid (C18:1 omega 9) accounted for 30.9% and elaidic acid (C18:1T), the trans isomer of oleic acid, comprised 11.3% of the total milk fatty acids. Linoleic (C18:2 omega 6) and linolenic (C18:3 omega 3) acid contents were 13.8 and 1.1%, respectively. The level of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was 1.4% for arachidonic (C20:4 omega 6) and 0.2% for eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 omega 3) acid. Conclusions: The milk from Iranian lactating mothers, as compared to that from the American or European mothers, contained high levels of medium-chain and trans fatty acids. This difference may be attributed to the maternal diet with low animal protein and animal fat but with high carbohydrate and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that carry large amounts of trans fatty acids. As the detrimental effects of trans fatty acids on blood lipids and cardiovascular diseases have been emphasized in the literature, a reduction of trans fatty acid content in the diet of Iranian mothers is suggested.

We used principal component (PC) and cluster analyses to identify the prevailing dietary patterns of 99 744 participants, aged 60 years or older, living in nine European countries and participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Elderly cohort) and to examine their socio-demographic and lifestyle correlates. Two PC were identified: PC1 reflects a 'vegetable-based' diet with an emphasis on foods of plant origin, rice, pasta and other grain rather than on margarine, potatoes and non-alcoholic beverages. PC2 indicates a 'sweet- and fat-dominated' diet with a preference for sweets, added fat and dairy products but not meat, alcohol, bread and eggs. PC1 was associated with a younger age, a higher level of education, physical activity, a higher BMI, a lower waist:hip ratio and never and past smoking. PC2 was associated with older age, less education, never having smoked, a lower BMI and waist:hip ratio and lower levels of physical activity. Elderly individuals in southern Europe scored positively on PC1 and about zero on PC2, whereas the elderly in northern Europe scored negatively on PC1 and variably on PC2. The results of cluster analysis were compatible with the indicated dietary patterns. 'Vegetable-based' and a 'sweet- and fat-dominated' diets are prevalent among the elderly across Europe, and there is a north-south gradient regarding their dietary choices. Our study contributes to the identification of groups of elderly who are likely to have different prospects for long-term disease occurrence and survival.""Barros, P. A. V., et al. (2013).

In contrast, the concentrations of medium chain saturated FA were linearly reduced (P<0.05) in butter fat from cows fed increasing levels of SO. Regarding the butter nutritional quality, a linear decrease (P<0.0001) in atherogenicity and thrombogenicity indexes and a linear increase (P<0.0001) in the hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio were observed compared to control, 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5% SO, respectively. Consistent with the increased (P<0.0001) concentration of mono and polyunsaturated FA, the OE of butter fat was linearly reduced (P<0.0001) as the dietary SO level increased. It was concluded that diet supplementation with SO improved the nutritional quality of butter fat of Holstein x Gir dairy cows as a result of positive changes in milk FA profile. However, these changes in milk FA composition were accompanied by a reduction in the SO of butter, which in turn is associated with a shorter shelf life.""Barton, P., et al. (2011). ""Effectiveness and cost effectiveness of cardiovascular disease prevention in whole populations: modelling study."" British Medical Journal 343."	1	"Objective To estimate the potential cost effectiveness of a population-wide risk factor reduction programme aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease. Design Economic modelling analysis. Setting England and Wales. Population Entire population. Model Spreadsheet model to quantify the reduction in cardiovascular disease over a decade, assuming the benefits apply consistently for men and women across age and risk groups. Main outcome measures Cardiovascular events avoided, quality adjusted life years gained, and savings in healthcare costs for a given effectiveness; estimates of how much it would be worth spending to achieve a specific outcome. Results A programme across the entire population of England and Wales (about 50 million people) that reduced cardiovascular events by just 1% would result in savings to the health service worth at least 30m pound ((sic)34m; $48m) a year compared with no additional intervention. Reducing mean cholesterol concentrations or blood pressure levels in the population by 5% (as already achieved by similar interventions in some other countries) would result in annual savings worth at least 80m pound to 100m pound. Legislation or other measures to reduce dietary salt intake by 3 g/day (current mean intake approximately 8.5 g/day) would prevent approximately 30 000 cardiovascular events, with savings worth at least 40m pound a year. Legislation to reduce intake of industrial trans fatty acid by approximately 0.5% of total energy content might gain around 570 000 life years and generate NHS savings worth at least 230m pound a year. Conclusions Any intervention that achieved even a modest population-wide reduction in any major cardiovascular risk factor would produce a net cost saving to the NHS, as well as improving health. Given the conservative assumptions used in this model, the true benefits would probably be greater.""Bassett, C. M. C., et al. (2010).

TFA are primarily from hydrogenated fats rich in elaidic acid, but dairy products also contain naturally occurring TFA such as vaccenic acid. Our purpose in this study was to compare the effects of consuming a commercially hydrogenated vegetable shortening rich in elaidic TFA (18:1t9) or a butter rich in vaccenic TFA (18:1t11) in the absence and presence of dietary cholesterol on atherosclerosis. LDL receptor deficient (LDLr(-/-)) mice were fed 1 of 8 experimental diets for 14 wk with the fat content replaced by: regular (pork/soy) fat (RG), elaidic shortening (ES), regular butter (RB), vaccenic butter (VB), or an atherogenic diet containing 2% cholesterol with RG (CH+RG), ES (CH+ES), RB (CH+RB), or VB (CH+VB). Serum cholesterol levels were elevated with cholesterol feeding (P < 0.001), whereas serum triglyceride levels were higher only in the CH+RB (P < 0.001) and CH+VB (P < 0.001) groups compared with the other 6 groups. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the CH+VB group than in the CH+RB group (P < 0.001). Atherosclerosis was stimulated by dietary ES compared with RG (P = 0.021), but CH+ES did not stimulate atherosclerosis beyond CH+RG alone. In contrast, VB did not induce an increase in atherosclerotic plaque formation compared with the RG and RB diets and the CH+VB diet reduced atherosclerosis compared with the other diets containing cholesterol (P < 0.01). In summary, consuming a hydrogenated elaidic acid-rich diet stimulates atherosclerosis, whereas a vaccenic acid-rich butter protects against atherosclerosis in this animal model. J.

Atherosclerosis 227(2): 414-419."	0	"Background: Consumption of plant sterols and plant stanols reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. At the same time, plasma plant sterol concentrations will increase after plant sterol consumption, but decrease after plant stanol consumption. In contrast to plant stanols, plant sterols can undergo oxidation and form oxyphytosterols. Findings from in vitro and animal studies suggest that oxyphytosterols might be atherogenic. Objective: The objective was to examine whether plant sterol and stanol consumption changes fasting plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations. Design: A randomized, double blind, cross-over study was performed in which 43 healthy subjects (18-70 years) consumed for 4 weeks a plant sterol-enriched (3.0 g/d of plant sterols), a plant stanol-enriched (3.0 g/d of plant stanols), and a control margarine separated by wash-out periods of 4 weeks. Oxyphytosterol concentrations were determined in BHT-enriched plasma via GC-MS. Results: Compared to control, serum LDL-C concentrations were reduced after plant sterol (-8.1%; p < 0.001) and plant stanol consumption (-7.8%; p < 0.001). Plant sterol consumption did not change plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations. On the other hand, intake of the plant stanol margarine reduced 7 beta-OH-campesterol by 0.07 ng/mL (similar to 14%; p < 0.01) and by 0.07 ng/mL (similar to 15%; p < 0.01) compared with the control and sterol margarines, respectively. When standardized for serum cholesterol, effects on these oxyphytosterols were comparable. In addition, plant stanol intake reduced cholesterol-standardized 7-keto-campesterol levels compared with plant sterol intake (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Daily consumption of a plant sterol-enriched margarine does not increase oxyphytosterol concentrations, while plant stanol consumption may reduce the concentrations of the oxidative plant sterol metabolites 7 beta-OH-campesterol and 7-keto-campesterol.

""Oxyphytosterol formation in humans: Identification of high vs. low oxidizers."" Biochemical Pharmacology 86(1): 19-25."	0	"Animal studies suggest that oxyphytosterols are atherogenic. However, we have previously shown that plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations did not increase after consuming a diet enriched in plant sterol esters (3 g/day), while minor reductions were seen after consuming a plant stanol ester-enriched diet. Large variations in oxyphytosterol concentrations between individuals however existed. The aim of this study was to identify factors that may explain inter-individual differences in plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations. For this, 43 subjects consumed for 4 weeks in random order a plant sterol, stanol and control margarine. Plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations were determined in butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)-enriched EDTA plasma via GC MS and serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) concentrations were analyzed via ELISA. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values, alpha-tocopherol concentrations and iron/copper status were determined to assess plasma oxidative and anti-oxidative capacity. Serum (non-oxidized) sitosterol and campesterol concentrations did not correlate with plasma oxysitosterol and oxycampesterol concentrations during any of the three dietary interventions. Moreover, plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations remained relatively stable overtime. Six subjects could be arbitrarily classified as having consistent low or high plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations, which was also reflected in oxLDL concentrations. However, oxidative and anti-oxidative capacity markers, such as iron/copper status, alpha-tocopherol concentrations and TEAC values, could not explain these differences. In conclusion, subjects seem to have consistent plasma oxyphytosterol concentrations, which resulted in the identification of low and high oxidizers'. Differences., however, could not be attributed to the oxidative and anti-oxidative capacity markers analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.""Baylin, A., et al. (2002). ""Adipose tissue biomarkers of fatty acid intake."" American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 76(4): 750-757."	2	"Background: Biomarkers can provide a more accurate measure of long-term intake than can dietary questionnaires. Objective: The objective was to identify which adipose tissue fatty acids are suitable biomarkers of intake as assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Design: Costa Rican men with a mean (+/- SD) age of 56 +/- 11 y (n = 367) and women aged 60 +/- 10 y (n = 136) completed a 135-item food-frequency questionnaire and provided art adipose tissue sample. Fifty fatty acids were identified by capillary gas chromatography. Correlation coefficients were calculated after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status. Results: The best adipose tissue marker for total intake of saturated fatty acids was 15:0 + 17:0 (r = 0.18). Both 15:0 and 17:0 were also the best correlates of dairy product intake (r = 0.31 for each). The diet-adipose tissue correlations for n-3 fatty acids were r = 0.34 for 18:3, r = 0.15 for 20:5, and r = 0.18 for 22:6, Fish intake correlated significantly with these adipose tissue n-3 fatty acids. Dietary and adipose tissue n-6 fatty acids were highly correlated: 18:2 (r = 0.58) and 18:3 (r = 0.24). The best indicators of total trans fatty acid intake were ct18:2n-6 and tc18:2n-6 (r = 0.58 for each); total 18:1 trans fatty acid (r = 0.45) and 16: 1 trans fatty acid (r = 0.16) were the next best indicators. Conclusions: Adipose tissue is a suitable biomarker of dietary fatty acid intake, particularly for n-3 and n-6 cis polyunsaturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids, Ideally, adipose tissue and dietary questionnaires should complement, rather than substitute for, each other in epidemiologic studies.""Baylin, A., et al.

The composition of the major saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids that are most abundant in the diet, is available for numerous foods in many countries, but data on the content of individual fatty acids with relative low abundance are scarce. We conducted a study to establish a fatty acid composition database that includes fatty acids with low relative abundance as well as trans fatty acids for the main sources of fat in the Costa Rican diet. Fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography. We present in-depth fatty acid composition tables for foods that are commonly used in Costa Rica. These analyses include information on alpha-linolenic, gamma-linolenic, arachidonic acid and trans fatty acids, which are important for health but where information is scarce. Of particular interest is the high content of trans fatty acids in partially hydrogenated soybean oil in Costa Rica, although decreasing over time. In a period of 10 years the amount of total trans fatty acids in Costa Rican soybean oil has decreased from an average of 20 to 1.5%, while alpha-linolenic has increased from an average of 1.87 to 6.06%.

Methods and Results-The baseline Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort consisted of 93 676 women ages 50 to 79 years of diverse ethnicity and background, of which 84 493 were eligible for analyses. Intakes of baked/broiled fish, fried fish, and omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid, alpha-linolenic acid), and trans-fatty acid were determined from the Women's Health Initiative food frequency questionnaire. Baked/broiled fish consumption was divided into 5 frequency categories: <1/mo (referent), 1 to 3/mo, 1 to 2/wk, 3 to 4/wk, >= 5/wk. Fried fish intake was grouped into 3 frequency categories: <1/mo (referent), 1-3/mo, and >= 1/wk. Associations between fish or fatty acid intake and incident HF were determined using Cox models adjusting for HF risk factors and dietary factors. Baked/broiled fish consumption (>= 5 servings/wk at baseline) was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.95) for incident HF. In contrast, fried fish consumption (>= 1 serving/wk at baseline) was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.84) for incident HF. No significant associations were found between eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, or trans-fatty acid intake and incident HF. Conclusions-Increased baked/broiled fish intake may lower HF risk, whereas increased fried fish intake may increase HF risk in postmenopausal women.

International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering 5."	0	"Hydrogenation of vegetable oils using stable catalysts with satisfactory activity and selectivity as well as very low trans fatty acid (TFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) production is a challenging task. It is known that unhealthy TFA formation is the result of positional and conjugative isomerization side-reactions occurring during hydrogenation. From this standpoint, it is possible to formulate active, selective and stable catalysts which would minimize the production of TFA and SFA. Monometallic Pd and bimetallic Pd-Me (Me=Mo, Ni, Co, Ru, and Sr,) highly dispersed on mesostructured SBA-silica material with pore size ranging from 6 to 7 nm, BET-specific surface of 800-900 m(2)/g, and metal nominal total loading up to 1.0 % w/w, were comparatively investigated as catalysts for lowering the unhealthy trans (TFA) and saturated (SFA) fatty acids and maximizing the highly health-beneficial cis-monoenes production during the hydrogenation of sunflower oil at 110 degrees C under hydrogen pressure of 5 atm. The Pd-catalyst at nominal metal loading of 0.8 % supported on nanostructured support was active and selective for the hydrogenation of sunflower oil under mild process conditions. It produced less saturated acid and reached a good selectivity towards monoenes. In all cases, the consecutive impregnations of Pd and a second metal on the mesoporous silica support preserved the mesoporous structure of the support with slight modification of the textural characteristics in terms of BET surface area, pore size distribution and total pore volume. The addition of nominal 0.2 % Co, Sr or Ru to 0.8% Pd-catalyst enhanced its activity. However, the addition of nominal 0.2 % Ni or Mo dropped the activity of monometallic Pd-catalyst significantly. It is clearly shown that Ru had some promoting effect to inhibit further the formation of trans fatty acids. The addition of a second metal to Pd-catalyst had no significant effect on the formation of C18:0. High degree of metal-metal, metal-support as well as metal-oil interactions would greatly influence the reaction mechanisms of the vegetable oil hydrogenation.""Bemelmans, W. J. E., et al. (2002).

Objectives: Our objectives were to assess the effect of increased ALA intakes on cardiovascular risk factors and the estimated risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) at 2 y and the effect of nutritional education on dietary habits. Design: Subjects with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (124 men and 158 women) were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to consume a margarine rich in either ALA [46% linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n-6) and 15% ALA; n = 114] or LA (58% LA and 0.3% ALA; n = 168).

Results: Average ALA intakes were 6.3 and 1.0 g/d in the ALA and LA groups, respectively. After 2 y, the ALA group had a higher ratio of total to HDL cholesterol (+0.34; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.56), lower HDL cholesterol (-0.05 mmol/L; -0.10, 0), higher serum triacylglycerol (+0.24 mmol/L; 0.02, 0.46), and lower plasma fibrinogen (-0.18 g/L; -0.31, -0.04; after 1 y) than did the LA a cup (adjusted for baseline values, sex, and lipid-lowering drugs). No significant difference existed in 10-y estimated IHD risk. After 2 y, the intervention group had lower saturated fat intakes and higher fish intakes than did the control group. Conclusions: Increased ALA intakes decrease the estimated IHD risk to an extent similar to that found with increased LA intakes.

Besides inducing dyslipidemia, TFA intake is suspected to promote abdominal and liver fat deposition. Objective: We examined the effect of a high intake of TFA as part of an isocaloric diet on whole-body, abdominal and hepatic fat deposition, and blood lipids in postmenopausal women. Methods: In a 16-week double-blind parallel intervention study, 52 healthy overweight postmenopausal women were randomized to receive either partially hydrogenated soybean oil providing 15.7 g day(-1) of TFA or a control oil with mainly oleic and palmitic acid. Before and after the intervention, body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, abdominal fat by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and liver fat by H-1 MR spectroscopy. Results: Compared with the control fat, TFA intake decreased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol by 10%, increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by 18% and resulted in an increased LDL/HDL-cholesterol ratio (baseline adjusted mean (95% CI) difference between diet groups 0.41 (0.22; 0.60); P<0.001). TFA tended to increase the body fat (0.46 (-0.20; 1.17) kg; P = 0.16) and waist circumference (1.1 (-0.1; 2.4) cm; P = 0.08) more than the control fat, whereas neither abdominal nor liver fat deposition was affected by TFA. Conclusion: The adverse effect of dietary TFA on cardiovascular disease risk involves induction of dyslipidemia, and perhaps body fat, whereas weight gain-independent accumulation of ectopic fat could not be identified as a contributory factor during short-term intake.

Present study claims the protective role CO against atherogenic index and lipid peroxidation under normal and stress conditions. PO though contains SFA possesses less beneficial effect than CO, but safer than VP in causing atherogenicity. Whereas VP by virtue of its hyperlipidemic and oxidative stress generating ability exhibits deleterious effects in causing atherogenicity. Hence the consumption of high content of TFAs may aggravate the occurrence of cardiovascular disease, this effect being worse when accompanied with stress.""Berasategi, I., et al. (2011).

The objective of the present study was to theoretically evaluate the nutritional relevance of incorporating selected enriched foods in the diet. Design: A 28 d dietary plan, designed to be balanced under the recommended macronutrients criteria, was used as a basal diet. Some conventional foods were exchanged with foods enriched in fibre, calcium, iodine, vitamins A, D, E or n-3 fatty acids. Setting: Nutritional composition of basal and modified diets was derived and compared to the Spanish recommended intakes (RI). Results: The basal diet covered the recommendations for fibre and calcium with mean intake of 28g and 1241 mg, respectively. The current intake of salt, if iodized, or bread elaborated with this salt, allowed reaching the daily intake of iodine every clay, with a mean supply of 216 mu g/d and 278 mu g/d, respectively.

Design: A crossover design study in 16 men compared fasting and postprandial lipid, glucose, insulin, and FVIIa concentrations at baseline and after a 3-wk diet providing 30 g unrandomized or randomized shea butter and sunflower oil blends (SSOBs), both of which contained approximate to 50% stearic acid. Fecal fat excretion was measured during each dietary period. Postprandial changes were assessed after the consumption of meals providing 50 g test fat. A subsequent study compared postprandial changes after the consumption of an oleic acid-rich sunflower oil meal and an unrandomized SSOB meal. Results: Both SSOBs were well digested and absorbed. Randomization did not affect fasting or postprandial lipid, glucose, insulin, or FVIIa concentrations. Compared with the oleic acid-rich meal, the unrandomized SSOB resulted in 53% lower postprandial lipemia, 23% higher hepatic lipase activity, and a 25% lower postprandial increase in FVIIa concentration. The solid fat contents at 37 degrees C were 22%, 41%, and 0% with the unrandomized SSOB, randomized SSOB, and oleic acid-rich meals, respectively. Conclusions: Stearic acid-rich triacylglycerol in both unrandomized and randomized forms does not adversely affect lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

To provide SA-specific information on the number of fatal CVD events (stroke, ischaemic heart disease and hypertensive heart disease) and non-fatal strokes that would be prevented each year following a reduction in the sodium content of bread, soup mix, seasoning and margarine. Methods. Based on the potential sodium reduction in selected products, we calculated the expected change in population-level systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality due to CVD and stroke. Results. Proposed reductions would decrease the average salt intake by 0.85 g/person/day. This would result in 7 400 fewer CVD deaths and 4 300 less non-fatal strokes per year compared with 2008. Cost savings of up to R300 million would also occur. Conclusion. Population-wide strategies have great potential to achieve public health gains as they do not rely on individual behaviour or a well-functioning health system. This is the first study to show the potential effect of a salt reduction policy on health in SA.""Bhupathiraju, S. N. and K. L. Tucker (2011).

Clinica Chimica Acta 412(17-18): 1493-1514."	2	"Diet is a key modifiable risk factor in the prevention and risk reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD). Results from the Seven Countries Study in the early 1970s spurred an interest in the role of single nutrients such as total fat in CHD risk. With accumulating evidence, we have moved away from a focus on total fat to the importance of considering the quality of fat. Recent meta-analyses of intervention studies confirm the beneficial effects of replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fatty acids on CHD risk. Scientific evidence for a detrimental role of trans fat intake from industrial sources on CHD risk has led to important policy changes including listing trans fatty acid content on the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel and banning the use of trans fatty acids in food service establishments in some cities. The effects of such policy changes on changes in CHD incidence are yet to be evaluated. There has been a surging interest in the protective effects of vitamin D in primary prevention. Yet, its associations with secondary events have been mixed and intervention studies are needed to clarify its role in CHD prevention. Epidemiological and clinical trial evidence surrounding the benefit of B vitamins and antioxidants such as carotenoids, vitamin E, and vitamin C, have been contradictory. While pharmacological supplementation of these vitamins in populations with existing CHD has been ineffective and, in some cases, even detrimental, data repeatedly show that consumption of a healthy dietary pattern has considerable cardioprotective effects for primary prevention. Results from these studies and the general ineffectiveness of nutrient-based interventions have shifted interest to the role of foods in CHD risk reduction. The strongest and most consistent protective associations are seen with fruit and vegetables, fish, and whole grains. Epidemiological and clinical trial data also show risk reduction with moderate alcohol consumption. In the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in nutritional epidemiology to examine associations between dietary patterns and health. Several epidemiological studies show that people following the Mediterranean style diet or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet have lower risk of CHD and lower likelihood of developing hypertension. Studies using empirical or data driven dietary patterns have frequently identified two patterns - ""Healthy or Prudent"" and ""Western"". In general, the ""Healthy"", compared to the ""Western"" pattern has been associated with more favorable biological profiles, slower progression of atherosclerosis, and reduced incidence. Evidence on changes in dietary patterns and changes in CHD risk is still emerging. With the emergence of the concept of personalized nutrition, studies are increasingly considering the role of genetic factors in the modulation of the association between nutrients and CHD. More studies of genetic variation and dietary patterns in relation to CHD are needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.""Bialek, A. and A. Tokarz (2013).

Postepy Higieny I Medycyny Doswiadczalnej 67: 6-14."	0	"Cancers are the second leading cause of deaths in Poland, among both women and men. Breast cancer is the malignancy most frequently diagnosed in women. In 2008 mammary cancer was diagnosed in up to 14 500 patients. It is also the second most common cause of cancer deaths among women in our country. Although the etiology of most cases of this disease is not known, risk factors include a variety of nutritional factors. The amount of fat consumed in the diet and the quantity and quality of fatty acids are especially crucial. Among fatty acids to which great importance in modification of cancer risk is attributed are conjugated linoleic acid. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid, with a conjugated double bond system in the carbon chain. The main natural source of them is milk and dairy products and meat of different species of ruminants, in which cis-9, trans-11 octadecadienoic acid (rumenic acid) occurs in the largest quantities, constituting over 90% of the total pool of CLA. Another important isomer is trans-10, cis-12 octadecadienoic acid, which occurs with rumenic acid in dietary supplements, usually in the ratio 1:1. Surveys conducted show their possible health promoting effects in obesity, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammation, and various types of cancer, especially breast cancer.""Bilal, T., et al.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8-weeks-old) weighing 161.78 +/- 3.88 g were divided into three equal groups. Group 1 (control) was fed basal diet (2% liquid-vegetable oil, 0% cholesterol), group 2 was fed high-cholesterol diet (2% liquid-vegetable oil, 15% hydrogenated-oil and 1.5% cholesterol) and group 3 was fed high-cholesterol diet with 1% beta-glucan. The trial period was 30 days. Blood samples were withdrawn on days 0 and 30. Also, all rats were weighed on same days. Serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were detected with commercial kits by auto-analyzer. Body weight gain, food intake and food conversion ratio, and serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower (P<0.05) in group 3 (the group fed fatty and added beta-glucan) than in the other two groups. Serum HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significant between all groups at the end of the study. beta-glucan supplementation negatively affected food intake. However, beta-glucan effectively lowered serum LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol concentrations without affecting HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Therefore, beta-glucan may decrease the cholesterol synthesizing ability of liver and the risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease. (C) 2011 PVJ. All rights reserved""Bilyeu, K., et al. (2011). ""Novel FAD3 Mutant Allele Combinations Produce Soybeans Containing 1% Linolenic Acid in the Seed Oil."" Crop Science 51(1): 259-264."	0	"Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] oil typically contains about 7% of linolenic acid, an oxidatively unstable fatty acid that is undesirable for many food applications. For cooking oil, reduction of the linolenic acid content by partial hydrogenation produces trans fatty acids, which are now known to increase the risk of coronary heart disease. Genetic reduction of linolenic acid was achieved decades ago, and recently the molecular genetic basis for both 3% and 1% linolenic acid soybean germplasm was revealed to be combinations of mutations in three independent members of the soybean omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (FAD3) genes that corresponded to the fan1, fan2, and fan3 loci. When the mutant GmFAD3A and GmFAD3C genes are found in combination in the breeding line CX1512-44, the linolenic acid content is reduced to approximately 3% of the of the seed oil. When the mutant GmFAD3A and GmFAD3B genes are in combination in the breeding line RG-10, a similar fatty acid profile is produced with approximately 3% linolenic acid. The objective of this work was to determine the ability of different combinations of mutant FAD3 alleles from CX1512-44 and an RG-10-derived soybean line to produce less than 3% linolenic acid in the seed oil. The results indicated that novel combinations of mutations in the three FAD3 genes are capable of producing soybean seeds containing only 1% linolenic acid in the seed oil.""Black, P. N. and S. Sharpe (1997). ""Dietary fat and asthma: Is there a connection?"" European Respiratory Journal 10(1): 6-12."	0	"The last two decades have seen an increase in the prevalence of asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis in developed countries. This increase has been paralleled by a fall in the consumption of saturated fat and an increase in the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet. This is due to a reduction in the consumption of animal fat and an increase in the use of margarine and vegetable oils containing od polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic acid. There is also evidence for a decrease in the consumption of oily fish which contain omega-3 PUFAs, such as eicosapentaenoic acid. In a number of countries, there are social class and regional differences in the prevalence of allergic disease, which are associated with differences in the consumption of PUFAs. Linoleic acid is a precursor of arachidonic acid, which can be converted to prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), whereas eicosapentaenoic acid inhibits the formation of PGE(2). PGE(2) acts on T-lymphocytes to reduce the formation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) without affecting the formation of interleukin-4 (IL-4). This may lead to the development of allergic sensitization, since IL-4 promotes the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE), whereas IFN-gamma has the opposite effect. Changes in the diet may explain the increase in the prevalence of asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis. The effects of diet may be mediated through an increase in the synthesis of prostaglandin E(2) which in turn can promote the formation of immunoglobulin E. (C)ERS Journals Ltd 1997.""Blewett, H.

Obese rats had higher proportions of splenic macrophages, total T-cells, helper T-cells (total and percentage CD25(+)), cytotoxic T-cells (total and percentage CD25+) and produced higher concentrations of IL-6 to concanavalin A (ConA) compared with lean rats. Obese rats had lower proportions of MLN T-cells, new T-cells (CD3(+)CD90(+)) and cytotoxic T-cells, but higher proportions of helper cells that were CD45RC(+), CD25(+) and CD4lo, and produced higher concentrations of IL-2, IL-10, interferon gamma and TNF alpha in response to ConA compared with lean rats. VA was higher in plasma phospholipids and both VA and CLA (cis-9, trans-11) were higher in MLN phospholipids compared with control-fed rats. Lean VA-fed rats had lower proportions of MLN and splenocyte CD45RC(+) helper cells, and helper T-cells. Splenocytes from VA-fed rats produced 16-23% less IL-2, IL-10 and TNF alpha compared with controls. VA normalised production of MLN IL-2 and TNF alpha in obese rats to levels similar to those seen in lean rats.

Materials and methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 2792 men and women from the MESA cohort of African-American, Caucasian, Chinese and Hispanic adults without known cardiovascular disease. Plasma phospholipid fatty acid proportions were associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the albumin/creatinine ratio. Results: Cis-vaccenic acid (18:1n-7), adjusted for other fatty acids using multivariate logistic regression (Cl: 1.0-1.4), and step-wise logistic regression (Cl: 1.02-1.42), was positively associated with reduced eGFR. The Framingham Risk Score, when adjusting for fatty acid proportions and demographic factors, was positively associated with CKD as measured by the eGFR and the albumin/creatinine ratio. Discussion and conclusions: Plasma phospholipid proportions of the 18 carbon monounsaturated cis-vaccenic acid (18:1n-7)) and the Framingham Risk Score are associated with kidney function. The potential role of 18:1n-7 in the development of CKD warrants further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.""Bochicchio, D., et al. (2005).

Lard may be a good lipid source but it contains 10-13% of linoleic acid, which makes the subcutaneous fat less suitable for long term curing of raw ham. Partial hydrogenation of lard decreases linoleic acid content, but increases trans-fatty acid content. This trial involved two groups of pigs of 114 kg live weight, fed for the last two months before slaughter with diets containing 3% lard (L) or 3% partially hydrogenated lard (PHL). The PHL contained about 10% trans-fatty acids and 2.5% linoleic acid. Rearing performance and carcass characteristics were unaffected by treatment. The group fed PHL showed a lower percentage of linoleic acid in the backfat (PHL 12.28% vs. L 13.04%) and a higher percentage of C18:1 trans-fatty acids both in backfat (0.5% vs. 0.06%) and in intramuscular fat (0.2% vs. 0.04%).

Twenty-five food groups are identified and their percentage contribution to each of the nutrients are reported. Clear differences in the nutrient sources occur between both the sexes and the social class groups. Quantitatively, the top four food items for men are alcoholic drinks, milk, potatoes and bread, and for women are milk, bread, fresh fruit and potatoes. Meat products (as distinct from carcass meat) and hard margarines are responsible for most of the differences in total fat, and saturated fat intake between the social class groups. Key differences occur in the percentage of vitamin C and fibre from fruit juice, fresh fruit, green vegetables and potatoes. The importance of carrots to carotene intake varies by social class and, in the manual groups, a greater percentage of vitamin E is derived from eggs and hard margarine than from soft margarine and vegetable oils. These data complement the findings that nutrient intakes differ between social class groups by highlighting the foods which bring this about. The information is relevant to dietitians and health educators who may wish to bring about dietary change in populations.""Boltonsmith, C., et al. (1995).

The potential risk from trans fatty acids may be greater in populations with relatively low intakes of essential fatty acids such as the Scots, who also have a high prevalence of heart disease. Means and ranges of trans fatty acid intakes are reported here for a Scottish population. A semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire was used to survey the diet of 10359 Scottish men and women aged 40-59 years in 1984-6 as part of the baseline Scottish Heart Health Study. Trans fatty acid levels were calculated for each food item on the questionnaire and the total subdivided into that which is derived naturally (primarily by bacterial fermentation in ruminants) and that which is produced during industrial hydrogenation (hardening) of vegetable and fish oils. Means and ranges of intakes of each trans fatty acid variable were calculated by sex, age, smoking and social class groups. Mean total trans fatty acid intakes for men were 7.1 (SD 3.1) g/d, 2.7 (SD 2.9)% energy and for women were 6.4 (SD 2.9) g/d, 3.3 (SD 3.0)% energy. Industrially hydrogenated trans fatty acids made up nearly 58% of the total intake for men and 61% for women, with about 60% coming from cakes, biscuits and sweets, and 20% coming from the cheaper hard margarines. The main sources of the naturally derived trans fatty acids were red meat (27%), milk (20%), butter (18-19%) and cheese (13-16%). Differences between age, smoking and social class groups were apparent. However, apart from the social class differences of up to 1 g/d, these were so small that they are unlikely to be of any biological significance unless compounded by other factors such as marginal essential fatty acid adequacy. The possibility of trans fatty acid intakes up to 48 g/d and 12% total energy (compared with the Department of Health (1991) recommendations of 5 g/d or 2% energy) highlights the need for careful monitoring of the health risks at these high levels of intake.""BoltonSmith, C., et al. (1996). ""Does dietary trans fatty acid intake relate to the prevalence of coronary heart disease in Scotland?"" European Heart Journal 17(6): 837-845."	1	"Reports of the effects of trans fatty acids on coronary heart disease are inconsistent. Trans fatty acids may particularly influence coronary risk when linoleic acid levels are low, a situation which occurs in Scotland where prevalence of coronary heart disease is also very high. The link between trans fatty acid intake and prevalent coronary heart disease was therefore investigated in the Scottish Heart Health Study population. Trans fatty acid intakes were calculated from 10/359 sets of food-frequency questionnaire data obtained from the cross-sectional survey of men and women aged 40-59 years. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratios for prevalent coronary heart disease by fifths of dietary intake of total, natural and commercial hydrogenation-derived trans fatty acid. The group who had undiagnosed coronary heart disease at the time of survey was the pertinent group for examining the possible causative effects of trans fatty acid intake. After adjustment for the confounding factors (i.e. age, weight? height: smoking, level of physical activity, blood pressure, total energy intake and intakes of saturated fat, linoleic acid and the antioxidant vitamins) the odds of undiagnosed coronary heart disease for men,relative to the lowest intake fifth, did not differ significantly from unity by total or commercially derived trans fatty acid intake. Odds were around 35% smaller in the higher intake fifths of naturally-derived trans fatty acids. For women, the odds of undiagnosed coronary heart disease tended to be greater in the higher fifths of total (odds ratio 1.36 (95% confidence interval 0.94, 1.89)) and hydrogenated (1.26 (0.92, 1.72)) trans fatty acid relative to the lowest fifth, but only reached significance in the third fifth of total trans fatty acid (1.36 (1.01, 1.83)). Dietary total and commercially-derived trans fatty acids failed to influence the odds of coronary heart disease for men, even though a significant increase in the ratio of low density plus very low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein-cholesterol occurred with trans fatty acid intake. The results, therefore, do not support a major effect of dietary trans fatty acid from commercial hydrogenation on coronary heart disease risk in these Scottish men. The results for women are less clear, and the possibility remains that individuals at the high extreme of trans fatty acid intake, who may be essential fatty acid deficient, are at enhanced risk of coronary heart disease.""Booker, C.

Nutrition Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases 18(6): 448-456."	2	"Background and aim: The recent interest in the development of evidence-based nutrition recommendations has resulted in the development of frameworks which enable a more structured evaluation of the Link between diet and chronic disease. This paper examines the application of the frameworks produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), by using as a case study the association between trans unsaturated fatty acids (TFAs) and coronary heart disease. TFAs arise during industrial hydrogenation of vegetable or fish fats and oils and the natural digestion process in ruminant animals. Data synthesis: Numerous studies have examined the effects of TFA intake on serum lipids and lipoproteins and the association between TFA consumption and cardiovascular disease. Metabolic studies and meta-analyses show a clear and consistent association between increasing TFA intakes and an adverse lipid profile. Evidence from case-control and prospective cohort studies examining the association between TFA intakes and coronary heart disease is more heterogeneous and there are limitations in several of the studies. Conclusion: White the evidence is sufficient to suggest a probable positive association between TFAs and coronary heart disease, and thus to justify a firm recommendation for a reduction in dietary TFA intake, the evaluation of the data underlines the difficulties in extrapolating the principles of evidence-based medicine to evidence-based nutrition. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research into the effects of animal-derived TFAs in amounts typically consumed in a western diet and their association with adverse lipid profiles or cardiovascular outcomes.

It is widely assumed that a dietary vitamin K-warfarin interaction exists. To avoid this potential interference with the efficacy of warfarin in stable anticoagulation, patients typically receive instructions to consume a constant dietary intake of Vitamin K. While dark, green vegetables are primary sources of dietary vitamin K, these foods are not commonly consumed on a daily basis in the United States. However, there still exists dietary resistance to warfarin that is attributable to vitamin K. Based on food analysis studies on vitamin K, it is now known that dietary Vitamin K is found in certain plant oils and prepared foods containing these plant oils, such as baked goods, margarines, and salad dressings. The preparation of foods with vitamin K-rich oils may also contribute to a diet-warfarin interaction, although this has yet to be confirmed in a clinical trial. A dose-response of vitamin K on the effect of warfarin anticoagulation has not yet been established. However, there are sufficient data to suggest that a constant dietary intake of vitamin K that meets current dietary recommendations of 65-80 mu g/day is the most acceptable practice for patients on warfarin therapy. Vitamin K composition data for commonly consumed foods are now available and may facilitate successful anticoagulation for patients being treated with warfarin.""Booyens, J. and C. F.

It would seem that our prediction may have been optimistic since it has now been reported that trans unsaturated fatty acids present in high concentrations in margarines promote hypercholesterolemia in humans (2). Consequently, there has been a call for the reclassification of dietary fats upon the basis of their hypercholesterolemic properties (3). Using the latter criterion, therefore, many margarine brands would be classified as coronary artery disease risk foods. The primary adverse metabolic action of trans unsaturated fatty acids is the competitive inhibition of delta-6-desaturase, the hepatic enzyme responsible for the initial metabolic desaturation of the essential fatty acids cis linoleic and cis alpha-linolenic acid. In addition to margarines, many other common foods such as deep-fried foods, many convenience foods and bakery products contain relatively high levels of trans fatty acids. Therefore, since it has become virtually impossible to avoid a consistent, daily dietary intake of trans fatty acids, it would appear that a precautionary, preventative supplementation of the diet with supplements containing the direct metabolic products of delta-6-desaturation of the essential fatty acids, would be prudent. Such supplements are readily available.""Borges, C. F., et al. (2012). ""Identification of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Parents/Caregivers of Children with Heart Diseases.""

Methods: Cross-sectional study of 150 parents or caregivers of children with heart diseases who attended a cardiology outpatient clinic. Data on identification, lifestyle and health conditions were collected by means of a structured questionnaire. For the assessment of the eating habits, a questionnaire on eating frequency was used; for the assessment of the nutritional status, weight, height, and waist circumference were measured, and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated and classified. Results: A total of 155 parents of children with heart diseases, predominantly of the female gender (91.6%), were evaluated; their mean age was 35.0 +/- 10.6 years. The most prevalent risk factors were sedentary lifestyle (85.2%), obesity (28%) and hypertension (22.6%). As regards the eating habits, a high frequency of intake of red meat, margarine, vegetable oil, and sugar and low intake of fish were observed. Comparison between genders showed a significant difference in relation to obesity, as detected by BMI, and hypertension, both more frequent among women. Waist circumference measurement also showed a higher cardiovascular risk in women. Conclusion: Cardiovascular risk factors such as excess weight, sedentary lifestyle, and hypertension as well as inadequate eating habits such as a high frequency of intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and low intake of unsaturated fat were identified in the parents/caregivers assessed.

The major trans 18:1 isomer in adipose tissue was Delta 11 trans, as in ruminant fats. Estimates of relative contribution of trans fatty acid intake were 55% from ruminant fats and 45% from PHVO. This pattern contrasts sharply with those established for Canada and the United States where PHVO is reported to be the major dietary source of trans fatty acids.""Bourque, C., et al. (2003).

The present objective was to examine the effect of a diet supplemented with a functional oil (FctO) composed of energy expenditure-enhancing MCT (50% of fat), cholesterol lowering phytosterols (22 mg/kg body weight), and triacylglycerol-suppressing n-3 fatty acids (5% of fat), versus a beef tallow-based diet (BT), on plasma lipid and aminothiol concentrations. In a randomized, single-blind, crossover design, partially-inpatient trial, 17 overweight women consumed each oil as part of a controlled, supervised, targeted energy balance diet for 27 days, with 4 or 8 weeks of washout between phases. Mean plasma total cholesterol concentration was lower (P < .0001), by 9.1%, on FctO (4.37 +/- 0.20 mmol/L) versus BT (4.80 +/- 0.20 mmol/L). Mean plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was also lower (P < .0001) following FctO (2.39 +/- 0.15 mmol/L) versus BT (2.86 +/- 0.16 mmol/L), representing a 16.0% difference between diets. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and circulating triacylglycerol concentrations remained unaffected by treatment. Ratios of HDL:LDL and HDL:total cholesterol were higher (P < .01) by 22.0% and 11.0%, respectively, on FctO versus BT. Plasma total homocysteine remained unchanged with FctO, but decreased (P < .05) with control, hence higher (P < .05) end points were observed with FctO (6.95 +/- 0.33 mumol/L) versus BT (6.27 +/- 0.28 mumol/L). Plasma glutathione increased (P < .05) by 0.44 mumol/L with FctO supplementation. In conclusion, despite equivocal effects on homocysteine levels, consumption of a functional oil composed of MCT, phytosterols, and n-3 fatty acids for 27 days improves the overall cardiovascular risk profile of overweight women.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic and seed traits of high-oleate and low-linolenate (HOLL) lines, high-oleate and normal-linolenate (HONL) lines, and normal-oleate and normal-linolenate (NONL) lines selected from four single-cross populations segregating for the three genes. A minimum of 14 F(3:5) lines of each class in the four populations were evaluated in five environments during 2009. The mean fatty ester concentrations averaged across populations were 786 g kg(-1) oleate and 24 g kg(-1) linolenate for the HOLL lines, 784 g kg(-1) oleate and 56 g kg(-1) linolenate for the HONL lines, and 226 g kg(-1) oleate and 75 g kg(-1) linolenate for the NONL lines. The mean yield of the NONL lines was significantly greater than the HOLL lines by 4.5% and the HONL lines by 3.0%. Of the 10 highest yielding lines in each population, 60% were NONL, 25% HOLL, and 15% HONL, which indicated that it would be possible to select cultivars of both classes that yield as well as NONL cultivars. The overlap among the three classes in the distributions of lines for protein, oil, seed weight, maturity, height, and lodging indicated that it would be possible to develop HOLL and HONL cultivars comparable to NONL cultivars for those traits.""Brennan, P., et al.

Cancer Causes & Control 11(1): 49-58."	0	"Objective: We have examined the role of dietary patterns and specific dietary nutrients in the etiology of lung cancer among non-smokers using a multicenter case-control study. Methods: 506 non-smoking incident lung cancer cases were identified in the eight centers along with 1045 non-smoking controls. Dietary habits were assessed using a quantitative food-frequency questionnaire administered by personal interview. Based on this information, measures of total carotenoids, beta-carotene and retinol nutrient intake were estimated. Results: Protective effects against lung cancer were observed for high consumption of tomatoes, (odds ratio (OR) = 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-0.6), lettuce (OR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.3-1.2), carrots (OR = 0.8; 95% CI 0.5-1.1), margarine (OR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.8) and cheese (OR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-1.0). Only weak protective effects were observed for high consumption of all carotenoids (OR = 0.8; 95% CI 0.6-1.0), beta-carotene (OR = 0.8; 95% CI 0.6-1.1) and retinol (OR = 0.9; 95% CI 0.7-1.1). Protective effects for high levels of fruit consumption were restricted to squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.4-1.2) and small cell carcinoma (OR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.4-1.2), and were not apparent for adenocarcinoma (OR = 0.9; 95% CI 0.6-1.3). Similarly, any excess risk associated with meat, butter and egg consumption was restricted to squamous and small cell carcinomas, but was not detected for adenocarcinomas. Conclusions: This evidence suggests that the public health significance of increasing vegetable consumption among the bottom third of the population would include a reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among lifetime non-smokers by at least 25%, and possibly more. A similar protective effect for increased fruit consumption may be present for squamous cell and small cell lung carcinomas.""Bretillon, L., et al. (2003). ""Might analysis, synthesis and metabolism of CLA contribute to explain the biological effects of CLA?"" European Journal of Medical Research 8(8): 363-369."	0	"Conjugated Linoleic Acids (CLA) are of great interest for analysts since techniques have been developed to determine the dietary occurrence of CLA with a good accuracy. CLA is found in animal products from ruminant sources as the result of biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the rumen and as the consequence of the delta-9 desaturation of vaccenic acid in animal tissues. CLA can also be obtained in the laboratory by isomerisation of linoleic acid or by total chemical synthesis. While the ""natural"" isomer is rumenic acid (9c,11t-18:2), synthetic mixtures contain mainly two isomers: the 9c,11t- and the 10t,12c-18:2. Although CLA have been shown to be metabolized into desaturated and chain elongated products, it remains unclear whether these so-formed conjugated metabolites may be involved in the effects of CLA on fatty acid metabolism. Experiments carried out on animal models with CLA have shown different health benefits: anticarcinogenic, antiatherosclerotic effects, modulation of body composition..., the ""natural"" CLA (9c,11t-18:2) being closely related to the protection against cancer and the 10t, 12c- 18:2 to the reduction of the fat mass. Nevertheless, recent findings have suggested adverse effects in mice. Most of the studies carried out on humans concern the influence of CLA on body composition and its possible inverse association with cancer. Since the results are still controversial and since very few data dealing with the safety of using CLA in long term feeding studies have so far been published, further works are warranted to consider the benefits of CLA for humans.""Briard-Bion, V., et al.

In this study, we examined the trans-octadecenoic acid (C18:1) composition of Emmental cheeses enriched in unsaturated fatty acids (FA) and manufactured with milks produced by cows selected to produce small and large fat globules. The FA composition of the milks was not significantly (P > 0.05) different from the FA composition of the corresponding Emmental cheeses. Increasing the unsaturated FA content of the cheeses using dietary manipulations lead to an increase in the trans-C18:1 and changed their isomeric profiles. In milk fat produced with the linseed-enriched diet, the trans-10 C18:1 concentration was greater than trans-11 C18:1 (vaccenic acid), which is classically the major trans-C-18:1 in milk fat. The content in trans-C18:1 and more particularly in trans-10 C18:1 was negatively correlated with the size of fat globules (r(2) = 0. 82 and 0.87, respectively) and related to milk fat depression. The trans-C18:1 content was negatively correlated with the saturated FA (slope = -0.35; r(2) = 0.81) and positively correlated with the unsaturated (slope = 0.29; r(2) = 0.85) and monounsaturated (slope = 0.32; r(2) = 0.81) FA.

Industrial trans fatty acids lower HDL cholesterol, raise LDL cholesterol, and increase the risk of coronary heart disease. The effects of conjugated linoleic acid and trans fatty acids from ruminant animals are less clear. We reviewed the literature, estimated the effects trans fatty acids from ruminant sources and of conjugated trans linoleic acid (CLA) on blood lipoproteins, and compared these with industrial trans fatty acids. Methodology/Principal Findings: We searched Medline and scanned reference lists for intervention trials that reported effects of industrial trans fatty acids, ruminant trans fatty acids or conjugated linoleic acid on LDL and HDL cholesterol in humans. The 39 studies that met our criteria provided results of 29 treatments with industrial trans fatty acids, 6 with ruminant trans fatty acids and 17 with CLA. Control treatments differed between studies; to enable comparison between studies we recalculated for each study what the effect of trans fatty acids on lipoprotein would be if they isocalorically replaced cis mono unsaturated fatty acids. In linear regression analysis the plasma LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio increased by 0.055 (95% CI 0.044-0.066) for each % of dietary energy from industrial trans fatty acids replacing cis monounsaturated fatty acids The increase in the LDL to HDL ratio for each % of energy was 0.038 (95% CI 0.012-0.065) for ruminant trans fatty acids, and 0.043 (95% CI 0.012-0.074) for conjugated linoleic acid (p = 0.99 for difference between CLA and industrial trans fatty acids; p = 0.37 for ruminant versus industrial trans fatty acids).

Evidence on health effects of ALA is not conclusive, but some observational studies found an increased risk of prostate cancer with higher intake of ALA. We examined the effect of ALA supplementation on serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker for prostate cancer. Methods: The Alpha Omega Trial (ClinicalTrials.govIdentifier: NCT00127452) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ALA and the fish fatty acids eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) on the recurrence of cardiovascular disease, using a 262 factorial design. Blood was collected at the start and the end of the intervention period. The present analysis included 1622 patients with a history of a myocardial infarction, aged 60-80 years with an initial PSA concentration,4 ng/mL. They received either 2 g per day of ALA or placebo in margarine spreads for 40 months. T-tests and logistic regression were used to assess the effects of ALA supplementation on changes in serum PSA (both continuously and as a dichotomous outcome, cut-off point: >4 ng/mL). Findings: Mean serum PSA increased by 0.42 ng/mL on placebo (n = 815) and by 0.52 ng/mL on ALA (n = 807), a difference of 0.10 (95% confidence interval: 20.02 to 0.22) ng/mL (P = 0.12). The odds ratio for PSA rising above 4 ng/mL on ALA versus placebo was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.84-1.58). Interpretation: An additional amount of 2 g of ALA per day increased PSA by 0.10 ng/mL, but the confidence interval ranged from 20.02 to 0.22 ng/mL and included no effect. Therefore, more studies are needed to establish whether or not ALA intake has a clinically significant effect on PSA or prostate cancer.""Brouwer, I. A., et al. (2013).

We therefore review the evidence from human studies on trans fatty acids and cardiovascular health, and provide a quantitative review of effects of trans fatty acid intake on lipoproteins. The results show that the effect of industrially produced trans fatty acids on heart health seen in observational studies is larger than predicted from changes in lipoprotein concentrations. There is debate on the effect of ruminant trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. Of special interest is conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is produced industrially for sale as supplements. Observational studies do not show higher risks of cardiovascular disease with higher intakes of ruminant trans fatty acids. However, CLA, industrial and ruminant trans fatty acids all raise plasma low-density lipoprotein and the total to high-density lipoprotein ratio. Gram for gram, all trans fatty acids have largely the same effect on blood lipoproteins. In conclusion, the detrimental effects of industrial trans fatty acids on heart health are beyond dispute. The exact size of effect will remain hard to determine. Further research is warranted on the effects of ruminant trans fatty acids and CLA on cardiovascular disease and its risk factors.""Bruckert, E. and D. Rosenbaum (2011).

In addition to these recommendations, some food ingredients such as plant sterol/stanol soy protein and isoflavones may help reduce cholesterol levels. Increased dietary fiber intakes are associated with significantly lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease and lower LDL-cholesterol concentration of about 5-10%. Beyond LDL-cholesterol lowering effects, other benefits have been observed on hypertension, diabetes mellitus. In this review, we summarize the different dietary approaches proven to be associated with LDL-cholesterol decrease. Nutritional interventions that do not exert significant LDL-cholesterol decrease have not been included in this review. Recent findings On top of a 'classical' step 1 and step 2 diet, the cornerstone of dietary recommendations, recent findings confirm the deleterious effects of trans fatty acid or the beneficial effects of sterols/stanols and nuts. Summary Dietary recommendations may have an impressive impact on cardiovascular events because they can be implemented early in life and because the sum of the effect on LDL-cholesterol is far from being negligible: step 1 diet (-10%), dietary fibers (-5 to -10%), plant sterols/stanols (-10%), nut consumption (-8%), and soy protein (-3 to -10%).""Bruckner, J.

In contrast to saturated fatty acids, however, trans fatty acids increase the lipoprotein (a) level. Epidemiological studies have shown a significant correlation between trans fatty acid intake and coronary heart disease. Because of the relatively low dally intake trans fatty acids are no reason for concern.

After 7 weeks washout, this was repeated with the alternate products. c9,t11 CLA concentration in plasma lipids was lower after consuming the control products, which may reflect the two-fold greater c9,t11 CLA content of the commercial products. Consuming the CLA-enriched dairy products increased the c9,t11 CLA concentration in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) (38 %; P=0.035), triacylglycerol (TAG) (22 %; P < 0.0001) and cholesteryl esters (205 %; P < 0.0001), and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (238 %; P < 0.0001), while tVA concentration was greater in plasma PC (65 %; P=0.035), TAG (98 %; P=0.001) and PBMC (84 %; P=0.004).

Sedentary lifestyle and transient changes in nutrition have led to drastic increases in such maladies during the last few decades, and dietary changes are significant, as they are coupled with high fat intake, especially trans fats. In developed countries, legislations and monitoring systems have resulted in reduced consumption of these metabolites. The developing world, especially South Asia, is also facing the menace of trans fats; lack of governmental interest and ignorance among consumers are the main reasons. In these regions, the use of hydrogenated vegetable oil (ghee) and shortening in deep-fat frying of culinary items, such as samosa, paratha, bhatura, poori, and tikkies, results in increased consumption of trans fats.

Participants - Food records were obtained from 1115 men and 1225 women aged 35 to 54 years, representing response rates of 84-86% in the three towns.

Polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratio was lowest in the current smokers. Men who smoked had higher energy intakes than those who did not. The lower fat intakes of beta-carotene, vitamin C, fibre, and polyunsaturated fat in the smokers was due to fewer smokers eating a whole range of foods including fruit, wholemeal bread, cereals, and poly-unsaturated margarine.

The cholesterol-lowering action of phytosterols/phytostanols is thought to occur, at least in part, through competition with dietary and biliary cholesterol for intestinal absorption in mixed micelles. However, recent evidence suggests that phytosterols/phytostanols may regulate proteins implicated in cholesterol metabolism both in enterocytes and hepatocytes. Important advances in the understanding of intestinal sterol absorption have provided potential molecular targets of phytosterols. An increased activity of ATP-binding cassette transporter Al (ABCAl) and ABCG5/G8 heterodimer has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the hypocholesterolaemic effect of phytosterols. Conclusive studies using ABCAl and ABCG5/G8-deficient mice have demonstrated that the phytosterol-tnediated inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption is independent of these ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Other reports have proposed a phytosterol/phytostanol action on cholesterol esterification and lipoprotein assembly, cholesterol synthesis and apolipoprotein (apo) B100-containing lipoprotein removal. The accumulation of phytosterols in ABCG5/G8-deficient mice, which develop features of human sitosterolaemia, disrupts cholesterol homeostasis by affecting sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 processing and liver X receptor (LXR) regulatory pathways.

Milk Fat/Sunflower Oil Blends as Trans Fat Replacers."	0	"As a body of evidence suggests that dietary trans fatty acids raise blood cholesterol levels, thereby increasing the risk of coronary heart disease, on July 11, 2003, FDA issued a final rule requiring the mandatory declaration in the nutrition label of the amount of trans fat present in foods, including dietary supplements. The agency required that the declaration of trans fat be on a separate line immediately under the declaration for saturated fat. Since there was no scientific basis for establishing a DV for trans fat, the final rule did not require the listing of a % DV as is required for some of the other mandatory nutrients, such as saturated fat. However, a report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has recommended a very low intake of TFA, less than 1% of daily energy intake. Therefore, efforts have been made and are ongoing to decrease TFA in the food supply both in the U.S. and globally. There are many challenges that food manufacturers have faced during the development of new trans fat alternatives. Any replacement ingredient must provide the functional characteristics of the material being replaced. In other words, the alternative ingredient must provide the functionality of flakiness, firmess of texture, crispness or desired appearance in the finished product or it is likely to be rejected by the consumer. The stability or shelf life of the finished product must also be maintained to ensure consumer acceptability. In some applications, like baked goods, a certain amount of solids is crucial. Consumer concerns associated with the atherogenic effect of trans fatty acids limit the future of the hydrogenation process as a way of modifying the solid-to-liquid ratio in vegetable oils/fats. As an alternative to hydrogenated vegetable oils, modification of high melting point stearins by blending with vegetable oils is becoming important, since shortenings with appropriate physicochemical properties and good nutritional characteristics that are free of trans fatty acids and rich in PUFA can be obtained. Thus, it is of interest to discuss the potential of blends of a stearin such as a high-melting fraction of milk fat with a vegetable oil as trans fat replacer. In this chapter the physical chemical properties of milk fat-sunflower oil low-trans blends, that is, crystallization behavior, polymorphism, microstructure and the effect of addition of emulsifiers in bulk systems will be reviewed.""Cantwell, M.

Information regarding the type, quantity and brand-name of fat used in cooking and at the table is required. In addition, margarine manufacturers may change the component oils used for reasons of cost, which changes the fatty acid composition of their products from season-to-season. Independent markers of fatty acid intake are required, therefore, to compensate for these limitations. Adipose tissue concentrations have been used as a measure of habitual intake of fatty acid groups and individual fatty acids in numerous studies. Saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are generally poorly correlated with adipose tissue concentrations, which can be explained partly by endogenous synthesis. In general, adipose tissue concentrations of exogenously-produced fatty acids (n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)) are well correlated with estimates of habitual intake. Correlations between dietary trans unsaturated fatty acids (TUFA) and adipose tissue concentrations vary between countries, which may be due to differences in dietary sources. Correlations may be affected by differences in bioavailability or selective retention of fatty acids in certain tissue lipids.""Cantwell, M. M., et al. (2005).

Public health efforts are therefore required to reduce TUFA intake in those individuals with high intakes.""Capita, R. and C. Alonso-Calleja (2003). ""Trans-fatty acids in the Spanish diet.""

Because of the possible link between trans-fatty acids (trans-FA) consumption and human disease (mainly cardiovascular disease and cancer), the health effects of trans-FA have been studied for over the last fifty years. This study aims at assessing the intake of trans-FA and their distribution throughout the day and during the week in a young adult Spanish population. The average trans-FA intake was 2.55+/-1.59 g/day (2.29+/-0.91% fat; 0.85+/-0.39% energy) in men and 2.49+/-1.84 g/day (2.64+/-1.25% fat; 0.96+/-0.48% energy) in women. Breakfast (8.00 a.m. approximately) followed by dinner (10.00 p.m. approximately) showed the highest trans-FA densities (g/1000 kcal), both in men and women. Higher (not significant) amounts of these fatty acids were found at the weekend rather than on weekdays. Average values in our study are lower than the upper limits established for European populations (2% energy) and than data found in other countries. However the high range of intakes observed (0.59 to 8.40 g/day in men and 0.39 to 12.80 g/day in women) makes it necessary for each case to be considered individually. Even though there is no evidence of risk at the low intake of trans-FA found in this study (further research into this whole area is needed), it is recommended that industry and individuals actively try to diminish the dietary trans-fatty acid levels in order to achieve an optimal diet so as to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.""Carta, G., et al. (2002). ""Modulation of lipid metabolism and vitamin A by conjugated linoleic acid."" Prostaglandins Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids 67(2-3): 187-191."	0	"The term conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a collection of positional and geometrical isomers of octaclecadienoic acid with conjugated double bonds. CLA has been shown to posses several beneficial activities in different experimental models, however, out of 28 isomers only two, c9, t11 and t10, c12 have been thus far demonstrated to be biologically active. The discovery that it can be elongated and desaturated as a regular fatty acid in human and animal tissues brought a new possibility that its activity may be related to its properties as a peculiar unsaturated fatty acid. In fact, CLA is able to be incorporated in lipid classes as oleic acid, accumulating in those tissues rich in neutral lipids; to be metabolized as linoleic acid and so influencing linoleic acid desaturation and elongation; and to be beta oxidized in peroxisomes which may account for, through activation of PPARs, its ability to increase free retinol levels and influence gene expression. These activities are amplified where CLA accumulates more such as mammary and adipose tissues and may explain its peculiar beneficial properties, at relative low dietary concentrations, in these tissues. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CLA can be endogenously formed by delta 9 desaturation of vaccenic acid (t11 18:1) thus forming the isomer c9, t11. Either endogenously formed or through dietary intake, CLA showed to be metabolized in the same way and to exert the same biological properties. We may conclude that a regular intake of CLA, or/and vaccenic acid as its precursor, should work as an excellent preventive agent by modulating lipid metabolism in target tissues thus conferring protection against the attack of insults of different type.

Although an adequate nutrition of cows has permitted to increase the amount of CLA in their milk, there is variation in CLA concentrations among cows consuming the same diet. It has been suggested that this variation is due either to changes in the activity of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD), changes in the gene expression, or to alterations in the ruminal process of biohydrogenation.

This could later represent a comparative marketing advantage for milk produced under grazing conditions. Most Colombian dairy cows graze on kikuyu grass and/ or ryegrass, but those pastures have a high demand for nitrogen, compromising the sustainability of those systems. A search for new pastures, selected for adaptation, compatibility and productivity has started. The association between Lotus uliginosus and kikuyu has interesting potential in terms of milk quality. The presence of legumes in the pasture allows to decrease the need for nitrogen fertilizer and increases the content of beneficial compounds in milk, such as secondary metabolites that modify biohydrogenation patterns and increase the production of CLA precursors.

Methods and results: We analyzed 7646 healthy subjects from the Moti-sani project, an on-going cross-sectional cohort study of men and women aged >= 35, randomly recruited from a general Italian population. The Italian EPIC food frequency questionnaire was used. Food patterns were generated using principal factor analysis (PFA) and reduced rank regression (RRR). Three dietary patterns were identified by PFA. The ""Olive Oil and Vegetables"" pattern, characterized by high intake of olive oil, vegetables, legumes, soups, fruits and fish, was associated with relatively lower values of glucose, lipids, CRP, blood pressure and individual global CVD risk score. The ""Pasta and Meat"" pattern, characterized by high intake of pasta, tomato sauce, red meat, animal fats and alcohol, was positively associated with glucose, lipids, CRP and CVD risk score. The ""Eggs and Sweets"" pattern, characterized by positive loadings of eggs, processed meat, margarines, butter, sugar and sweets, was associated with high values of CRP. The first RRR pattern was similar to the ""Pasta and Meat"" pattern both in composition and association with CVD risk profile.

Patients and Methods: English human clinical trials measuring surrogate and clinical end points. Results: Antioxidants have not been consistently proven beneficial in reducing cardiovascular mortality. Fish oils may be beneficial in patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, but therapeutic doses need to be defined. Use of coenzyme Q10 in patients with heart failure has not demonstrated consistent benefits. Garlic may lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, but also may increase bleeding, so its use in CVD patients should be monitored. Clinical studies with small sample sizes have demonstrated that L-arginine may be useful to prevent and treat CVD, The Food and Drug Administration recommends 25 g/day of soy protein as part of a diet low in saturated fats for cholesterol reduction, Plant sterols are recommended by the American Heart Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel as adjunct therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein.

However, very little information is available on the effect of natural sources of TFA coming from milk fat, dairy products and ruminant meat. In fact, due to the naturally low level of TFA in milk fat, it is almost impossible to conduct a clinical trial with a limited number of subjects (< 200). Methodology: To compare the effects of industrial and natural dietary sources of TFA, two specific test fats have been designed and produced. A substantial amount of milk fat (130 kg) enriched in TFA has been produced by modification of the cow's diet and selection of cows with the highest TFA content. The level obtained was approximately 4- to 7-fold higher than typically present in milk fat (similar to 20 instead of 3-6 g/100 g of total fatty acids). The control fat is composed of PHVO balanced in saturated fatty acids (lauric, myristic and palmitic). Both experimental fats contain about 20-22% of monounsaturated TFA and the volunteers' daily experimental fat intake (54 g), will represent about 12.0 g/day of TFA or 5.4% of the daily energy (based on 2000 kcal/day). These two test fats have been incorporated into food items and will be provided to 46 healthy subjects under a randomised, double blind, controlled, cross-over design. The primary outcome is high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), which is an independent risk factor for CVD. Other parameters such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and HDL-C level and subclasses will be also to be evaluated.

Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study among 14,916 apparently healthy men who provided blood samples in 1982. Blood fatty acid levels were determined for 476 men diagnosed with prostate cancer during a 13-year follow-up and their matched controls. Controls were individually matched to cases according to age and smoking status at baseline. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk and 95% confidence interval of total, nonaggressive (stage A/B and low grade), and aggressive (stage C/D, high grade, subsequent distant metastasis or death) prostate cancer associated with blood levels of specific trans-fatty acids. Results: Blood levels of all the trans-fatty acids examined were unrelated to total prostate cancer risk. When results were divided according to tumor aggressiveness, blood levels of 18:1n-9t, all the 18:2t examined, and total trans-fatty acids were positively associated to nonaggressive tumors. The relative risks (95% confidence intervals; P trend) comparing top with bottom quintile trans-fatty acid levels were 2.16 (1.12-4.17, 0.11) for 18:1n-9t, 1.97 (1.03-3.75; 0.01) for total 18:2t, and 2.21 (1.14-4.29; 0.06) for total trans-fatty acids. None of the trans fats examined was associated with aggressive prostate tumors.

Reduction of LDL levels was the primary end point; effects on other lipid parameters and withdrawal of study patients due to adverse effects were the secondary end points. Weighted estimates of percent change in LDL were -11.0% for plant sterol and stanol esters 3.4 g/day (range 2-9 g/day [893 patients]) versus -2.3% for placebo (769 patients) in 23 eligible studies, compared with -23.7% for policosanol 12 mg/day (range 5-40 mg/day [1528 patients]) versus -0.11% for placebo (1406 patients) in 29 eligible studies. Cumulative p values were significantly different from placebo for both (p<0.0001). The net LDL reduction in the treatment groups minus that in the placebo groups was greater with policosanol than plant sterols and stanols (-24% versus -10%, p<0.0001). Policosanol also affected total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglyceride levels more favorably than plant sterols and stanols. Policosanol caused a clinically significant decrease in the LDL:HDL ratio.

Therefore the results indicate that when total fat is reduced to levels recommended for individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease, the use of unsaturated margarine rather than butter by hypercholesterolaemic individuals is associated with a lipoprotein profile which would be expected to be associated with reduced cardiovascular risk.""Cho, Y.

Food and Chemical Toxicology 47(7): 1550-1555."	2	"The objective of this study was to explicate the effects of feeding low trans structured fat from flaxseed oil (LF) on plasma and hepatic lipid metabolism involved in apo E-/- mice. The animals were fed a commercial shortening (CS), commercial low trans fat (CL) and LF diet based on AIN-76 diet (10% fat) for 12 weeks. LF supplementation exerted a significant suppression in hepatic lipid accumulation with the concomitant decrease in liver weight. The LF significantly lowered plasma total cholesterol and free fatty acid whereas it significantly increased HDL-C concentration and the HDL-C/total-C ratio compared to the CS group. Reduction of hepatic lipid levels in the LF group was related with the suppression of hepatic enzyme activities for fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, and cholesterol regulating enzyme activity compared to the CS and CL groups. Accordingly, low trans structured fat from flaxseed oil is highly effective for improving hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid accumulation in apo E-/- mice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Decades of research from the cardiovascular sciences on fats have led investigators to focus on specific types of fats rather than total fat as a whole. They have established that saturated and trans-unsaturated fats (trans fats) are damaging to cardiovascular health while polyunsaturated fats, particularly the marine omega 3 fatty acids appear protective. This has led to a number of studies investigating the associations of fat and AMD. Though the causal relationship between fats and AMD remain unproven, some studies suggest that an association may be present. To be able to understand and interpret the study results and their implications, an understanding of the fats in the diet is important. This review aims to give an overview of fatty acids, particularly the trans-unsaturated fatty acids, and the relevant food groups.""Chorfa, N., et al. (2010).

Lp(a) levels were measured in a double-blind study of 29 men and 29 women who ate 4 controlled diets in random order for 6 weeks each. Fatty acids represented 39% to 40% of energy. The diets were: (1) Oleic (16.7% of energy as oleic acid); (2) Moderate trans (3.8% of energy as trans-monoenes, approximately the trans content of the U.S. diet); (3) High trans (6.6% of energy as trans-monoenes); (4) Saturated (16.2% of energy as lauric plus myristic plus palmitic acids). The Saturated diet lowered Lp(a) levels significantly (by 8% to 11%). Compared to the Oleic diet, the trans diets had no adverse effect on Lp(a) levels when all subjects were considered collectively. A subset with initially high levels of Lp(a) (greater than or equal to 30 mg/dL), however, responded to the High trans diet with a slight (5%) increase in Lp(a) levels relative to the Oleic and Moderate trans diets. Thus, in amounts commonly found in the typical U.S. diet, saturated fatty acids consistently decrease Lp(a) concentrations. The adverse effects of replacing cis-with trans-fatty acids are only suggestive and are restricted to high trans intakes in subjects with high Lp(a) levels.""Clifton, P. M., et al. (2004).

Epidemiologic studies showed a relation between TFA intake and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), but studies examining adipose tissue TFAs have not uniformly confirmed this. We performed a case control study examining both adipose tissue levels and dietary intake of TFAs and first MI. Between 1995 and 1997, 209 cases of first MI completed a 300-item FFQ and 79 had an adipose tissue biopsy; 179 matched controls completed the FFQ and 167 had a biopsy. During the course of the study (mid-1996), TFAs were eliminated from margarines sold in Australia. Cases biopsied before mid-1996 had greater levels of trans 18:1(n-9) (32% P < 0.03) and trans 18:1 (n-11) (23%, P < 0.001) than controls biopsied before mid-1996. After June 1996, there were no differences between cases and controls in any of the adipose tissue TFAs measured. Logistic regression showed that trans 18:1 (n-11) (P = 0.03) was an independent predictor of a first MI. Cases consumed 0.5 g/d (P = 0.002) more TFAs than controls. Subjects in the highest quintile of TFA intake had an OR for first MI of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-4.3), which was not independent of saturated fat intake. Apparent TFA intake from margarine was related to adipose tissue 18:1t[(n-9) and (n-10)] in 1995 (r = 0.66, 0.66, respectively).

In this research we evaluate the optimal mix of lifestyle, pharmaceutical and population-wide interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Methods and Findings: In a discrete time Markov model we simulate the ischaemic heart disease and stroke outcomes and cost impacts of intervention over the lifetime of all Australian men and women, aged 35 to 84 years, who have never experienced a heart disease or stroke event. Best value for money is achieved by mandating moderate limits on salt in the manufacture of bread, margarine and cereal. A combination of diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor and low-cost statin, for everyone with at least 5% five-year risk of cardiovascular disease, is also cost-effective, but lifestyle interventions aiming to change risky dietary and exercise behaviours are extremely poor value for money and have little population health benefit. Conclusions: There is huge potential for improving efficiency in cardiovascular disease prevention in Australia. A tougher approach from Government to mandating limits on salt in processed foods and reducing excessive statin prices, and a shift away from lifestyle counselling to more efficient absolute risk-based prescription of preventive drugs, could cut health care costs while improving population health.""Cohen, J.

Objective: We examined associations of maternal trans fatty acid intake during pregnancy with fetal growth. Design: We studied 1369 mother-child pairs participating in Project Viva-a prospective cohort study of pregnant women and their offspring. We assessed trans fatty acid consumption by using a validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire in each of the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. We estimated fetal growth as the birth-weight-for-gestational-age (BW/GA) z value in infants born at term. Results: We observed no associations of first-trimester trans fatty acid consumption with fetal growth. In the second trimester, the estimated mean (+/-SD) total trans fatty acid intake was 2.35 +/- 1.07 g/d, of which 0.11 g was 16: 1(n27t), 1.78 g was 18: 1 (n-9t), 0.13 g was 18: 2(n-6tt), 0.33 g was 18: 2(n-6tc), and 0.12 g was 18: 2(n-6ct).

One side effect associated with plant sterol consumption is a modest reduction in plasma carotenoid concentrations. This study investigated the effect of consuming a low-fat National Cholesterol Education Programme (NCEP) Step 1 diet, including a low-fat plant sterol ester (PSE)-enriched spread on cholesterol metabolism to determine if specific dietary advice to increase daily fruit and vegetable intake could prevent reduced plasma carotenoid concentrations. Materials and methods In this randomised, crossover double-blind trial, 48 hypercholesterolaemic men received 21 g day(-1) of a low-fat PSE-enriched spread or placebo for 3 weeks, interrupted by 3 weeks washout. Individuals also adhered to a NCEP Step 1 diet and repeated 3-day food diaries monitored adherence. Specific advice was provided to increase dietary fruit and vegetable intakes. Fasting blood samples were collected at pre- and post-intervention for lipoprotein and carotenoid analysis. Results Plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were significantly (P<0.05) reduced, by 4.6 and 7.1%, respectively, after the PSE-enriched low-fat spread. Plasma apo B concentrations were significantly (P<0.0005) lower after the PSE spread. PSE consumption was also associated with significantly (P<0.05) lower total plasma &beta;-carotene concentrations, but this change was not significant after lipid standardisation. PSE consumption had no effect on retinol, &alpha;-carotene, &gamma;-tocopherol, cl-tocopherol, lutein, zeaxanthin, &beta;-crypyoxanthin or lycopene concentrations. Conclusion Dietary advice to increase daily fruit and vegetable consumption may be effective in preventing a reduction in plasma carotenoid concentrations previously associated with PSE consumption. Further, PSE incorporated in a low-fat spread and consumed as part of a NCEP Step 1 diet are effective in reducing total and LDL cholesterol.""Collison, K. S., et al. (2011).

Sexual dimorphism exists in the physiological and transcriptional response to diet, particularly in response to high-fat feeding. Consumption of Trans-fatty acids (TFA) has been linked to substantially increased risk of heart disease, in which sexual dimorphism is apparent, with males suffering a higher disease rate. Impairment of the cardiovascular system has been noted in animals exposed to Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) during the neonatal period, and sexual dimorphism in the growth axis of MSG-treated animals has previously been noted. Processed foods may contain both TFA and MSG. Methods: We examined physiological differences and changes in gene expression in response to TFA and/or MSG consumption compared to a control diet, in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Results: Heart and % body weight increases were greater in TFA-fed mice, who also exhibited dyslipidemia (P < 0.05). Hearts from MSG-fed females weighed less than males (P < 0.05). 2-factor ANOVA indicated that the TFA diet induced over twice as many cardiac differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in males compared to females (P < 0.001); and 4 times as many male DEGs were downregulated including Gata4, Mef2d and Srebf2. Enrichment of functional Gene Ontology (GO) categories were related to transcription, phosphorylation and anatomic structure (P < 0.01). A number of genes were upregulated in males and downregulated in females, including pro-apoptotic histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2). Sexual dimorphism was also observed in cardiac transcription from MSG-fed animals, with both sexes upregulating approximately 100 DEGs exhibiting sex-specific differences in GO categories. A comparison of cardiac gene expression between all diet combinations together identified a subset of 111 DEGs significant only in males, 64 DEGs significant in females only, and 74 transcripts identified as differentially expressed in response to dietary manipulation in both sexes. Conclusion: Our model identified major changes in the cardiac transcriptional profile of TFA and/or MSG-fed mice compared to controls, which was reflected by significant differences in the physiological profile within the 4 diet groups. Identification of sexual dimorphism in cardiac transcription may provide the basis for sex-specific medicine in the future.""Colon-Ramos, U., et al. (2006).

Initially, the median quintiles of total adipose tissue TFA were 1.85, 2.47, 2.99, 3.58, and 4.40 g/100 g; total TFA was positively associated with increased MI risk after adjusting for established risk factors (OR by quintiles of total TFA: 1.00, 1.37, 1.91, 1.86, 3.28; P for trend < 0.001).

Adipose tissue 18:1 trans fatty acids were not associated with risk of MI before or after the modification. Although to date there are no TFA regulations in Costa Rica, it appears that indirect international influence has led to a TFA reduction in the food supply and, consequently, to a reduction in the risk of nonfatal MI. The public health sector of Costa Rica should regulate food labeling and content to ensure very low levels of TFA intake.""Colon-Ramos, U., et al. (2007).

This qualitative study uses a conceptual framework to identify factors that may impede or promote the process of translation of scientific evidence about TFA into policy in the specific context of Costa Rica. We used single case-study methodology to integrate two sources of data: review of relevant internal documents and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 respondents purposively sampled from three sectors: the cooking oil and food industries, research and academia, and government entities. Content analysis, guided by a conceptual framework of research utilization, revealed 68 emergent themes divided across four categories of analysis. In brief, study participants perceived the political context suitable for discussing policies related to healthy fats. Nevertheless, TFA regulation was not part of the Costa Rican political agenda. Barriers perceived by respondents that impede knowledge translation included: (1) lack of awareness of in-country scientific studies on health effects of TFA; (2) lack of consensus or information about policy options (nutrition labelling, dietary guidelines, legislative mandates); (3) perceived distrust and disparate attitudes between sectors, believed by study participants to result in (4) limited collaboration across sectors. Commissioned task forces and other mechanisms to foster research engagement and facilitate sustained interaction and systematic collaboration among government, food industry and researcher sectors appear crucial in the consideration and adoption of nutrition policy in Costa Rica and other emerging economies.""Combe, N., et al.

This trans isomer, in some cases, can also lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Epidemiological studies on associations between TFA intake and risk of CHD are still not conclusive.

However, its effects on the sitostanol concentrations in the blood and tissues are relatively unknown, especially in patients with sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis. These patients hyperabsorb all sterols and fail to excrete ingested sitosterol and other plant sterols as normal people do. The goal of the present study was to examine the absorbability of dietary sitostanol in humans and animals and its potential long-term effect. Two patients with sitosterolemia were fed the margarine Benecol (McNeill Nutritionals, Ft. Washington, PA), which is enriched in sitostanol and campestanol, for 7-18 wk. Their plasma cholesterol levels decreased from 180 to 167 mg/dL and 153 to 113 mg/dL, respectively. Campesterol and sitosterol also decreased. However, their plasma sitostanol levels increased from 1.6 to 10.1 mg/dL and from 2.8 to 7.9 mg/dL, respectively. Plasma campestanol also increased. After Benecol withdrawal, the decline in plasma of both sitostanol and campestanol was very sluggish. In an animal study, two groups of rats were fed high-cholesterol diets with and without sitostanol for 4 wk. As expected, plasma and liver cholesterol levels decreased 18 and 53%, respectively. The sitostanol in plasma increased fourfold, and sitostanol increased threefold in skeletal muscle and twofold in heart muscle. Campestanol also increased significantly in both plasma and tissues. Our data indicate that dietary sitostanol and campestanol are absorbed by patients with sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis and also by rats. The absorbed plant stanols were deposited in rat tissues. Once absorbed by sitosterolemic patients, the prolonged retention of sitostanol and campestanol in plasma might increase their atherogenic potential.""Corl, B. A., et al. (2003).

Both fatty acids were provided as a natural component in butter fat. The conversion of VA to CLA by Delta9-desaturase was documented previously in several species, including rats and humans. Specifically, our objective was to determine the relative contribution of dietary VA and CLA to the tissue concentration of CLA and its ability to inhibit the development of mammary carcinomas. A total of 7 diets were formulated with varying levels of CLA and VA. The overall dietary treatment scheme was designed to evaluate the modulation of mammary cancer risk by 1) small increases of CLA in the presence of a low level of VA and 2) more substantial increases of VA against a background of low levels of CLA. As expected, small increases in dietary CLA at the low end of the CLA dose-response range did not reduce tumorigenesis. In contrast, there was a distinct and marked inhibitory response to VA that was dose dependent. The effect of VA was magnified in this experiment because the dose range of VA tested was much broader than that of CLA. Fatty acid analysis showed that the conversion of dietary VA to CLA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of CLA in the mammary fat pad, which was accompanied by a parallel decrease in tumor formation in the mammary gland. The finding confirms that the conversion of VA to CLA is as important for cancer prevention as the dietary supply of CLA. Thus, VA is also anticarcinogenic, and VA and CLA represent functional food components that are present in ruminant fat.""Costa, A. G. V., et al. (2006).

In addition, trans isomeric seems to inhibit the action of desaturase enzymes of essential fatty acids (A5- and A6-desaturase) by holding back the biosynthesis of important fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). With respect to pregnant women's and infant's health, concentrations of trans fatty acids ingested by the mother are associated to concentrations found in the maternal milk. Besides the milk, the trans fatty acids can be transferred to the newly born through the placenta. Studies suggest that trans fatty acids can affect intrauterine growth due to the inhibition of the conversion of essential fatty acids by desaturase enzymes. The inhibition of DHA can also cause early atherosclerosis lesion. However, studies on the effects of trans fatty acids on health are still inconclusive and there are no current recommendations on their consumption. Additionally, in Brazil, studies to determine the composition of trans isomeric in foods are still incipient, which indicates a great need of research in this area.""Counil, E., et al. (2009).

The purpose of the present study was to assess the association between TFA and plasma lipid profiles in Inuit men and women living in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada). In a cross-sectional, population-based survey, a total of 795 Nunavik Inuit eligible participants gave a blood sample. Exposure to TFA was assessed by their relative proportion in erythrocyte membrane. We performed multiple regression analysis using plasma lipids or their linear combinations as the dependent variables and TFA as the main predictor, adjusting for potential confounders. The associations varied markedly between the sexes and according to age. In men (n 357, aged 36.3 (So 14.3) years, TFA 1.24 (SD 0.54) %), TFA tended to be negatively associated with HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), apoA1 and LDL particle size, and positively associated with non-HDL-C, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apoB100, the apoB]00:apoA] ratio and the ratios of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C and TAG to HDL-C. No such trends were observed in women (it 438, aged 37.0 (So 14.1) years, TFA 1.16 (SD 0.54) %), except for HDL-C and apoA1 in women aged 50 years and more. These results suggest that TFA could raise the risk of CHD in Inuit men at least through their physiological effects on plasma lipids. The differential associations reported in pre- and postmenopausal women need to be reproduced in other populations and in experimental studies addressing the influence of sex hormones in response to dietary fats.""Craig-Schmidt, M.

Lipids 36(9): 997-1006."	0	"""Isomeric fatty acids"" is a term that refers to the trans- and positional isomers formed during hydrogenation of naturally occurring oils. The purposes of this paper are as follows: (i) to summarize potential exposure of infants to isomeric fatty acids by reviewing estimates of isomeric fatty acids in the maternal diet, in human milk, and in infant formula/infant foods, and (ii) to evaluate the evidence for adverse effects of isomeric fatty acids on infant development with respect to growth, and essential fatty acid status. Estimates of the intake of trans-fatty acids vary widely both within and across populations. Current estimates of trans-fatty acids in the North American population are 4-11% of total fatty acids or 3-13 g/(person(.)d), whereas in Mediterranean countries in which olive oil is the primary fat and in Far Eastern countries in which little commercially hydrogenated fat is consumed, per capita consumption of trans-fatty acids is <1-2 g/d. The trans-fatty acid content of human milk reflects the cross-cultural variation in the maternal diet, with trans-fatty acids in human milk samples ranging from 6 to 7% in North America to <0.5% in Hong Kong. Trans-fatty acids are transferred from the maternal diet through the placenta to the developing fetus or through milk to the breast-fed infant. In some studies, plasma trans-fatty acids are inversely related to birth weight and head circumference. The hypothesis that dietary trans-fatty acids could inhibit biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids with 20 and 22 carbon atoms and thus affect infant development is supported by studies demonstrating an inverse correlation of plasma trans-fatty acids with n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in infants. However, no such relationship has been observed in human milk. A definitive answer concerning a potentially adverse effect of dietary trans-fatty acids on infant development awaits future studies.""Crupkin, M. and A. Zambelli (2008).

As a consequence, different regulatory actions have been developed around the world, aiming to reduce human consumption of TFA. Replacement for TFA functionality requires incorporation of plastic and stable saturated fats; the present options are palm or fully hydrogenated oils. Palm oil has been described as responsible for negative biological effects on serum cholesterol levels and CVD risk. Different epidemiological and clinical studies recommend reduction of saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake, mainly myristic and palmitic acids. Experimental evidence strongly suggests that stearic acid is a wholesome substitute for TFAs and other SFAs in food manufacturing. In this article, biological effects of stearic acid on human health are reviewed in comparison to TFAs, SFAs, and unsaturated fatty acids.

Journal of Aoac International 87(2): 545-562."	0	"Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are octadecadienoic acids (18:2) that have a conjugated double-bond system. Interest in these compounds has expanded since CLA were found to be associated with a number of physiological and pathological responses such as cancer, metastases, atherosclerosis, diabetes, immunity, and body fat/protein composition. The main sources of these conjugated fatty acids are dairy fats. Rumen bacteria convert polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially linoleic and linolenic acids, to CLA and numerous trans-containing mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids. It has been established that an additional route of CLA synthesis in ruminants and monogastric animals, including humans, occurs via Delta9 desaturation of the trans-18:1 isomers. To date, a total of 6 positional CLA isomers have been found in dairy fats, each occurring in 4 geometric forms (cis,trans; trans,cis; cis,cis; and trans,trans) for a total of 24. All of these CLA isomers can be resolved only by a combination of gas chromatography (GC), using 100 m highly polar capillary columns, and silver-ion liquid chromatography, using 3 of these 25 cm columns in series. Complete analysis of all the trans-18:1 isomers requires prior isolation of trans monoenes by silver-ion thin-layer chromatography (TLC), followed by GC analysis using the same 100 m capillary columns operated at low temperatures starting from 120degreesC. These analytical techniques are required to assess the purity of commercial CLA preparations, because their purity will affect the interpretation of any physiological and/or biochemical response obtained. Prior assessment of CLA preparations by TLC is also recommended to determine the presence of any other impurities. The availability of pure CLA isomers will permit the evaluation and analysis of individual CLA isomers for their nutritional and biological activity in model systems, animals, and humans. These techniques are also essential to evaluate dairy fats for their content of specific CLA isomers and to help design experimental diets to increase the level of the desired CLA isomers in dairy fats. These improved techniques are further required to evaluate the CLA profile in monogastric animals fed commercial CLA preparations for CLA enrichment of animal products. This is particularly important because absorption and metabolism will alter the ingested-CLA profile in the animal fed.""Czernichow, S., et al. (2005).

Results Added oils and fats were the main source of total fat intake. Animal fat and margarine intakes showed a significant inverse association with educational level, whereas oils with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were positively associated with education level. Animal fat intake was significantly higher in the western and northern parts of France (54.2% and 50.4%) and lower in the Mediterranean Coast (39.0%). A significant inverse gradient was found with oils with polyunsaturated fatty acids or MUFA in the southwest and the Mediterranean Coast compared with the northern part of France. Conclusions We showed a north to south gradient for animal fat intake and the opposite for oils with MUFA and polyunsaturated fatty acid in France. This gradient parallels the known disparities for cardiovascular mortality in this country.

Nutrition Journal 9."	0	"Growing consumer interest in grass-fed beef products has raised a number of questions with regard to the perceived differences in nutritional quality between grass-fed and grain-fed cattle. Research spanning three decades suggests that grass-based diets can significantly improve the fatty acid (FA) composition and antioxidant content of beef, albeit with variable impacts on overall palatability. Grass-based diets have been shown to enhance total conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (C18:2) isomers, trans vaccenic acid (TVA) (C18:1 t11), a precursor to CLA, and omega-3 (n-3) FAs on a g/g fat basis. While the overall concentration of total SFAs is not different between feeding regimens, grass-finished beef tends toward a higher proportion of cholesterol neutral stearic FA (C18: 0), and less cholesterol-elevating SFAs such as myristic (C14:0) and palmitic (C16:0) FAs. Several studies suggest that grass-based diets elevate precursors for Vitamin A and E, as well as cancer fighting antioxidants such as glutathione (GT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as compared to grain-fed contemporaries. Fat conscious consumers will also prefer the overall lower fat content of a grass-fed beef product. However, consumers should be aware that the differences in FA content will also give grass-fed beef a distinct grass flavor and unique cooking qualities that should be considered when making the transition from grain-fed beef. In addition, the fat from grass-finished beef may have a yellowish appearance from the elevated carotenoid content (precursor to Vitamin A). It is also noted that grain-fed beef consumers may achieve similar intakes of both n-3 and CLA through the consumption of higher fat grain-fed portions.""Dashti, N., et al. (2000).

The net accumulation in the medium of apolipoprotein A-I (apoiA-I) was not significantly altered by fatty acids, whereas that of apoB was increased with oleic and elaidic acids. Oleic acid, and to a lesser extent elaidic and palmitic acids, increased the mass of triglycerides in the medium and the incorporation of [H-3]glycerol into secreted triglycerides. The incorporation of [C-14]acetate into cellular and secreted total cholesterol was stimulated by 96% and 83%, respectively, with elaidic acid but was not significantly modified by oleic or palmitic acid. Relative to oleic acid, the secretion of C-14-labeled phospholipids and triglycerides was decreased 28% to 31% with elaidic and palmitic acids whereas that of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters was enhanced 93% and 73%, respectively, with elaidic acid but remained unchanged with palmitic acid. Compared with oleic acid, elaidic acid stimulated the secretion of very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-Chol), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Chol), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-Chol) by 43%, 70%, and 34%, respectively, whereas palmitic acid decreased VLDL-Chol but had no significant effect on LDL-Chol and HDL-Chol. The ratios of total cholesterol to HDL-Chol were 3.17, 3.60, and 3.25 with oleic, elaidic, and palmitic acids, respectively; the corresponding ratios of LDL-Chol to HDL-Chol were 0.87, 1.10, and 0.93, respectively. Compared with oleic and palmitic acids, the LDL and HDL particles secreted in the presence of elaidic acid contained higher levels of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters and a lower content of phospholipids. The phospholipid-to-total cholesterol ratios of HDL were 1.05, 0.40, and 0.76 with oleic, elaidic, and palmitic acids, respectively.

Body weight, food intake, food efficiency coefficient, lipoprotein lipase activity, serum concentrations of total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triacylglycerols and albumin were assessed. The heart and liver tissues underwent histological assessment. Results The type of lipid source did not influence food intake, weight gain or food efficiency coefficient. The activity of the lipoprotein lipase was also unaffected; however, there were changes in the serum concentration of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triacylglycerols and albumin. All groups presented lipid droplets on the coronary walls and heart capillaries. The fat deposition on the liver of animals given soybean oil, fish fat and lard, and butter was characterized as steatosis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, in 2003, on a representative sample of 2,298 male and female subjects, including 803 adolescents (12 to 19 years), 713 adults (20 to 59 years) and 782 elderly people (60 years or over). Food intake was measured using 24-hour recall. Mean trans fatty acid intake was described according to gender and age group. RESULTS: The mean trans fatty acid intake was 5.0 g/day (SE = 0.1), accounting for 2.4% (SE = 0.1) of total energy and 6.8% (SE = 0.1) of total lipids. The adolescents had the highest mean intake levels (7.4 g/day; 2.9% of energy) while the adults and the elderly had similar intake (2.2% of energy for both; 6.4% of lipids and 6.5% of lipids, respectively). The mean trans fatty acid intake among adult and elderly women (approximately 2.5% of energy and 7.0% of lipids) was higher than among men in the same age group. The food item with the highest contribution towards trans fatty acids was margarine, accounting for more than 30% of total intake, followed by filled cookies among adolescents and meat among adults and the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: The trans fatty acid intake is above the level recommended by the World Health Organization. Replacement of the trans fatty acids in manufactured food items may be an effective measure for reducing trans fatty acid intake in Brazil.""De Jong, A., et al. (2008).

Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, intervention trial. Setting: University. Subjects: Forty-five patients on current statin treatment were recruited via newspaper advertisements. Data of 41 patients were used in statistical analysis. Intervention: Subjects consumed margarine with no added plant sterols or stanols for 4 weeks and were then divided into three groups of 15 subjects. For the next 16 weeks, one group continued with the control margarine and the other two groups with either a plant sterol- or stanol (2.5 g/day)-enriched margarine. Blood was sampled at the end of the run-in and intervention periods. Results: Plant sterol and stanol consumption significantly (P = 0.026) reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 0.34 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI), -0.67 to -0.04 mmol/l). No effects were shown on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and markers of oxidative modification of lipids and DNA.

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of plant sterols on cholesterol and vascular function in prepubertal children with FH. We included 41 children (5-12 years old) with FH in a double-blind crossover trial using spreads containing 2.3 g of plant sterols (mainly sitosterol and campesterol) per 15 g spread and a placebo spread for a 4-week period, separated by a 6-week washout period. Lipid levels and endothelial function were assessed after both 4-week treatment periods. Endothelial function was assessed as flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery using a wall tracking system. Data were compared to those of 20 healthy controls. Intake of 2.3 g plant sterols per day decreased total cholesterol (-11%) and low-density cholesterol (-14%) as compared to placebo spread in FH children. FH children treated with placebo spread were characterized by an impaired FMD compared to healthy control children (7.2%+/-3.4% versus 10.1%+/-4.2%, p<0.005). However, the reduction of LDL in FH children did not improve FMD (placebo: 7.2%&PLUSMN;3.4% versus plant sterols: 7.7%&PLUSMN;4.1%).

Obtaining an optimal ratio of the two essential fatty acids, linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids - ie a ratio of less than 4 to 1 in the diet - is a major issue. The main sources of alpha-linolenic acid for the European population should be canola oil (and canola-oil based margarine if available), nuts (English walnut), ground linseeds and green leafy vegetables such as purslane.

Setting and Results: Epidemiological studies as well as randomised dietary trials suggest that Mediterranean diet may be important in relation to the pathogenesis (and prevention) of CHD. For instance, a striking protective effect of an ALA-rich Mediterranean diet was reported in the Lyon Diet Heart Study with a 50 to 70% reduction of the risk of recurrence after 4 years of follow-up in CHD patients. According to our current knowledge, dietary ALA should represent about 0.6 to 1% of total daily energy or about 2 g per day in patients following a Mediterranean diet, whereas the average intake in linoleic acid should not exceed 7 g per day. Supplementation with very-long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (about 1 g per day) in patients following a Mediterranean type of diet was shown to decrease the risk of cardiac death by 30% and of sudden cardiac death by 45% in the GISSI trial. Conclusions: In the context of a diet rich in oleic acid, poor in saturated fats and low in omega-6 fatty acids (a dietary pattern characterising the traditional Mediterranean diet), even small doses of omega-3 fatty acids (about 1 g EPA+DHA the form of fish oil capsules or 2 g alpha-linolenic acid in canola oil and margarine) might be very protective.

We studied the effects of a saturated fat diet supplemented with fish oil, trans10,cis12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), or elaidic acid on lipid and glucose metabolism and liver protein levels of APOE*3 Leiden transgenic mice, a model for lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. Fish oil lowered plasma and liver cholesterol and triglycerides, plasma free fatty acids, and glucose but increased plasma insulin. CLA lowered plasma cholesterol but increased plasma and liver triglycerides, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin. Elaidic acid lowered plasma and liver cholesterol. Proteomics identified significant regulation of 65 cytosolic and 8-membrane proteins. Many of these proteins were related to lipid and glucose metabolism, and to oxidative stress. Principal component analysis revealed that fish oil had a major impact on cytosolic proteins, and elaidic acid on membrane proteins. Correlation analysis between physiological and protein data revealed novel clusters of correlated variables, among which a metabolic syndrome cluster. The combination of proteomics and physiology gave new insights in mechanisms by which these dietary fatty acids regulate lipid metabolism and related pathways, for example, by altering protein levels of long-chain acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase and adipophilin in the liver.""de Roos, B., et al.

However, there appear to be differences between saturates in their effect on HDL cholesterol. We investigated whether the consumption of a solid fat rich in lauric acid (C12:0) would result in a more favorable blood lipid profile than the consumption of a solid fat rich in trans-fatty acids. We fed 32 healthy men and women two controlled diets in a 2 x 4-wk randomized crossover design. The diets consisted of a background diet supplemented with margarines. In the trans-diet, 9.2% of energy was provided by trans-fatty acids and 12.9% by saturated fatty acids. In the Sat-diet, energy intake was 0% from trans-fatty acids and 22.9% from saturated fatty acids. Lauric acid composed one third of all saturates in the Sat-diet. Serum HDL cholesterol was 0.36 mmol/L lower at the end of the trans-diet than at the end of the Sat-diet (95% confidence interval, -0.46 to -0.26), whereas serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations remained stable. Serum total cholesterol was 0.31 mmol/L (95% confidence interval, -0.48 to -0.14) lower at the end of the trans-diet than at the end of the Sat-diet. Consumption of a solid fat rich in lauric acid gives a more favorable serum lipoprotein pattern than consumption of partially hydrogenated soybean oil rich in trans-fatty acids. Thus, solid fats rich in lauric acids, such as tropical fats, appear to be preferable to trans-fats in food manufacturing, where hard fats are indispensable.""Dehaan, L. H. J., et al. (1994).

In order to investigate which part of the LDL particle would be involved in inhibition of metabolic co-operation between human smooth muscle cells in culture we tested several fatty acids and their breakdown products, namely aldehydes. Unsaturated C-18 fatty acids markedly influenced gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), whereas saturated (C18:0, C16:0) and unsaturated fatty acids with >20 carbon atoms did not inhibit GJIC.

The most potent inhibitor of GJIC was linoleic acid, which inhibited GJIC by 75%. No correlation was found between degrees of unsaturation and ability to inhibit GJIC. Of the tested aldehydes, hexanal, propanal, butanal and 4-hydroxynonenal did significantly inhibit GJIC, while pentanal had no effect. Since modification of LDL was shown to be important in order for LDL to inhibit GJIC, these results show that fatty acids and their oxidative breakdown products may be of importance for the inhibition of GJIC by LDL.""Derdemezis, C.

In this review, we consider the effects of PS beyond LDL-C lowering. Plant sterols/stanols exert beneficial effects on other lipid variables, such as apolipoprotein (apo) B/apoAI ratio and, in some studies, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). Plant sterols/stanols may also affect inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, as well as platelet and endothelial function. Evidence also exists about a beneficial effect on oxidative stress, but this does not seem to be of greater degree than that expected from the LDL-C lowering. Many of these effects have been demonstrated in vitro and animal models. Some in vitro effects cannot be seen in vivo or in humans at usual doses. The epidemiological studies that evaluated the association of plasma PS concentration with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk do not provide a definitive answer. Long-term randomized placebo-controlled studies are required to clarify the effects of supplementation with PS on CVD risk and progression of atherosclerosis.""Devaraj, S., et al. (2004).

Therapeutic lifestyle changes include dietary modifications such as inclusion of phytosterols, which effectively lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in margarines and other fats. Their effectiveness in nonfat moieties is not yet established. The aim of this study was to examine if phytosterols alter the plasma lipoprotein profile when incorporated into nonfat orange juice. Methods and Results - After a 2-week run-in phase with orange juice, 72 mildly hypercholesterolemic healthy subjects were randomized to receive either placebo orange juice ( placebo OJ) or plant sterol-fortified orange juice ( sterol OJ) (2g/d) for 8 weeks. Fasting blood was obtained at baseline, after 2 weeks of OJ, and after 8 weeks of placebo/sterol-OJ supplementation. Sterol OJ supplementation significantly decreased total (7.2%), LDL (12.4%), and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (7.8%) compared with baseline and compared with placebo OJ ( P < 0.01). Apolipoprotein B levels were significantly decreased (9.5%) with sterol OJ. There were no significant changes in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides with the sterol OJ. While folate and B12 levels significantly increased, homocysteine levels were unchanged. Conclusions - Orange juice fortified with plant sterols are effective in reducing LDL cholesterol and could easily be incorporated into the therapeutic lifestyle changes dietary regimen.""Dhaka, V., et al.

Research has proved the direct connection of trans fatty acids with cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer, shortening of pregnancy period, risks of preeclampsia, disorders of nervous system and vision in infants, colon cancer, diabetes, obesity and allergy. In light of these new findings trans fatty intake should be zero and new technology of hydrogenation of oils is to be developed which produce zero trans fatty acids at the same time preserve the desirable properties contributed by trans fatty acids to the hydrogenated oils. Presently in India there is no system to monitor and regulate the amount of trans fats in processed foods and hence a stringent food law is immediately required.""Dhibi, M., et al. (2011). ""The intake of high fat diet with different trans fatty acid levels differentially induces oxidative stress and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in rats.""

Little is known about the effects on the liver induced by lipids and also few studies are focused on the effect of foods rich in TFAs on hepatic functions and oxidative stress. This study investigates whether high-fat diets with different TFA levels induce oxidative stress and liver dysfunction in rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups (n = 12/group): C receiving standard-chow; Experimental groups that were fed high-fat diet included 20% fresh soybean oil diet (FSO), 20% oxidized soybean oil diet (OSO) and 20% margarine diet (MG). Each group was kept on the treatment for 4 weeks. Results: A liver damage was observed in rats fed with high-fat diet via increase of liver lipid peroxidation and decreased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase). The intake of oxidized oil led to higher levels of lipid peroxidation and a lower concentration of plasma antioxidants in comparison to rats fed with FSO. The higher inflammatory response in the liver was induced by MG diet. Liver histopathology from OSO and MG groups showed respectively moderate to severe cytoplasm vacuolation, hypatocyte hypertrophy, hepatocyte ballooning, and necroinflammation. Conclusion: It seems that a strong relationship exists between the consumption of TFA in the oxidized oils and lipid peroxidation and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The extent of the peroxidative events in liver was also different depending on the fat source suggesting that feeding margarine with higher TFA levels may represent a direct source of oxidative stress for the organism. The present study provides evidence for a direct effect of TFA on NAFLD.""Dictenberg, J. B., et al. (1995).

To examine this possibility in a fat-sensitive model, the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) was used to compare the cholesterolemic and triglyceridemic potential of modest increments of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated soybean oil with other saturated fatty acids in the presence and absence of dietary cholesterol. Age-, dose-, and time-dependent effects were examined in weanling, 6-month-old, and 1-year-old gerbils. Although lipoprotein metabolism in weanling gerbils was initially refractory to trans fat, even as perturbations by saturated fatty acids were demonstrable, these gerbils eventually (after 16 weeks) developed a trans-induced hypercholesterolemia that was intermediate between the response to 16:0 and 12:0 + 14:0. The hepatic and plasma 18:1/18:2 cholesteryl ester (CE) ratio was depressed by trans in a manner similar to saturated fatty acids. The 6-month-old gerbils readily developed hypertriglyceridemia but not hypercholesterolemia, again revealing a decrease in the plasma 18:1/18:2 CE ratio. The 1-year-old gerbils revealed a dose-related (0, 5, 10%en as trans) elevation in total cholesterol (TC), and especially triglycerides (TG), that was accentuated by 0.04% dietary cholesterol. Increases in plasma lipids were again accompanied by a significant decrease in the mass of hepatic esterified cholesterol, particularly 18:1-cholesteryl esters. Thus, dietary trans-fatty acids induce age-, time-, and dose-dependent modulations in gerbil plasma lipids associated with decreased 18:1 cholesteryl esters. Further investigation with gerbils may reveal mechanisms by which trans fat consumption disturbs lipoprotein metabolism.""DiRienzo, M. A., et al. (2008).

The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact on fatty acid intake in the United States if HSLL were substituted for partially hydrogenated soybean oils used in several food categories, including baked goods, shortenings, fried foods, and margarines. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (1999-2002), baseline intakes of five fatty acids and trans fatty acids (TFA) were determined at the mean and 90th percentile of fat consumption. Then intakes of these fatty acids were determined after HSLL was substituted for 100% of the partially hydrogenated soybean oils used in these four food categories. The results show that baseline intake of stearic acid is 3.0% energy at the mean and 3.3% energy at the 90th percentile. Use of HSLL could increase stearic acid intake to about 4-5% energy. Mean intakes of TFA could decrease from 2.5 to 0.9% energy, and intake of palmitic acid would remain unchanged. Use of HSLL as a substitute for partially hydrogenated soybean oils would result in changes in the fatty acid composition of the US diet consistent with current dietary recommendations.""Dixit, S. and M.

In this study, analysis of fatty acid composition and TFA content in edible oils and fats along with the possible intake of trans-fat in Indian population was carried out. The analysis was carried out as per the Assn. of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methodology and the results were statistically analyzed. The average TFA content in nonrefined mustard and refined soybean oils exceeded by 1.16- to 1.64-fold as compared to the Denmark limit of 2% TFA in fats and oils destined for human consumption. In branded/nonbranded butter and butter oil samples, average TFA limit exceeded by 4.2- to 9.5-fold whereas hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) samples exceeded the limit by 9.8-fold, when compared to Denmark standards. The probable TFA intake per day through different oils in Indian population were found to be less than WHO recommendation. However Punjab having highest consumption of HVO (15 g/d) showed 1.09-fold higher TFA intake than the WHO recommendation, which is alarming and may be one of the factors for high cardiovascular disease mortality rate that needs further elucidation. Thus there is a need to prescribe TFA limit for edible oil, butter, and butter oil in India and to reduce the already proposed TFA levels in HVO to safeguard the health of consumers. Practical Application: The probable daily intake of trans-fatty acid (TFA) especially through hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) was assessed. In absence of any specification for TFA and fatty acid composition for edible oils, butter, and butter samples, a pressing need was felt to prescribe TFA limit in India. The study indicates that TFA intake through HVO consumption is higher in States like Punjab than the recommended daily intake prescribed by WHO. Hence, strategies should be adopted to either decrease the consumption of HVO or to modify the industrial processing method of HVO with less content of TFA to safeguard the health of consumers.""Djousse, L., et al.

Results of flow cytometry (FACS) analysis showed significant reductions in boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) fluorescence-labeled fatty acid uptake by 35.4 and 40.2% with WBE and BBE treatment, respectively. BBE treatment significantly reduced the expression of fatty acid transport protein-4 and CD36 in Caco-2 cells, as determined by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Similar trends were found in WBE treatment, although to a lesser degree.

In this review, the use of margarines containing stanol or sterol esters, to lower LDL cholesterol is considered in the 2011 setting. Firstly, there is a brief overview of the effects of the stanols/sterols on LDL cholesterol, which shows that these agents have a modest ability to lower LDL cholesterol, and are not effective in all conditions. Secondly, the relevance of the stanols/sterols in 2010/1 is questioned, given they have not been shown to reduce clinical endpoints, and have no effects on HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Finally, there is a section comparing the stanols/sterols with the present day prescription lipid lowering medicines. Prescription drugs (statins, ezetimibe, and niacin) have a much greater ability to lower LDL cholesterol than the stanol/sterol esters, and also increase levels of HDL cholesterol and decrease levels of triglycerides. The statins and niacin have been shown to reduce cardiovascular clinical endpoints. Except in borderline normo/hypercholesterolemia, prescription drugs should be preferred to stanol/sterol esters for lowering LDL cholesterol in 2011. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.""Dong, C.

These derivatives were designed to improve their chemical stability and liposolubility by protecting Danshensu's phenolic hydroxyl groups with acetyl or methylene which could be readily hydrolyzed to release bioactive Danshensu. The asymmetric synthesis of 1a and 1b were achieved by catalytic hydrogenation of (Z)-methyl 2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-diacetoxyphenyl)-2-propenoate (6a) and (Z)-methyl 2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-propenoate (6b) in excellent enantiomeric excesses (92% ee and 98% ee, respectively) and good yields (>89%). An unexpected intermediate product, (Z)-2-acetoxy-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) acrylic acid (4c) was obtained with high chemoselectivity in 86% yield by keeping the reaction temperature at 60 degrees C and its structure was identified by Xray single crystal diffraction analysis. 1a, 1b and their racemates 7, 10 as well as 4c exhibited potent protective activities against hypoxia-induced cellular damage. The in vitro test showed that all these compounds could increase cell viability, and inhibit lipid hyperoxidation. Furthermore, 1a and 4c could inhibit apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related molecule in gene and protein levels, up-regulating the expression of bcl-2 and down-regulating bax and caspase-3. The in vivo test indicated that 4c exhibited anti-myocardial ischemic effects featured by reducing infarction size and increasing the level of the intracellular enzymes detectable in serum. Therefore, these Danshensu derivatives may be good drug candidates for anti-myocardial ischemia therapy and merit further investigation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Animal Production Science 51(1): 19-29."	0	"In ruminants, extensive ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids (FA) results in numerous cis and trans isomers of 18:1 and of conjugated and non-conjugated 18: 2, the incorporation of which into ruminant products depends on the composition of the diet (forage vs concentrate) and of dietary lipid supplements. The low amount of 18:3n-3 (alpha-linolenic acid) absorbed explains its limited incorporation in meat and milk lipids. Its protection against hydrogenation has been an objective for several decades, but only encapsulation in a protein matrix is efficient. In non-ruminants, the FA composition of products is determined by dietary FA, despite minor differences in digestibility and in metabolic activity. Physicochemical differences in intestinal absorption processes between ruminants and non-ruminants can explain the lower FA digestibility in non-ruminants, especially for saturated FA. Unlike in non-ruminants, FA digestibility in ruminants does not depend on FA intake, except for 18:0. The decrease in cow butterfat, especially with concentrate diets, is generally attributed to t10-18:1 or t10, c12-18:2, but the regulation is probably more complex. Differences in terms of butterfat content and FA composition of milk between cow, ewe and goat responses to the amount and composition of ingested lipids are due to between-species variations in mammary metabolism. In animals bred for meat production, dietary 18: 3n-3 results in increases in this FA and in n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated FA (20:5n-3, 22:5n-3) in muscles. The extent of this increase depends both on animal and nutritional factors. Grass is a source of 18:3n-3, which contributes to increased 18:3n-3 in muscle of ruminants as well as of pigs. Conjugated linoleic acids are mainly present in fat tissues and milk due to t11-18:1 desaturation. Their concentration depends on tissue type and on animal species. Non-ruminants fed synthetic conjugated linoleic acids incorporate them in significant amounts in muscle, depending on the isomer. All dietary manipulations favouring polyunsaturated FA incorporation in milk and meat lipids increase the risk of lipoperoxidation, which can be efficiently prevented by use of dietary combined hydro-and lipophilic antioxidants in the diet. Putative effects on organoleptic and technological quality of products deserve further studies.""Dorfman, S. E., et al. (2005).

The effect of dietary fats (coconut oil, butter, traditional stick margarine, soybean oil, canola oil) differing in fatty acid profile on this antiatherogenic process was assessed with respect to plasma lipids; exogenous and endogenous lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activities; and LCAT, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and scavenger receptor B class-1 (SR-B1) mRNA abundance. Golden-Syrian hamsters were fed a nonpurified (6.25 g/100 g fat) diet containing an additional 10 g/100 g experimental fat and 0.1 g/100 g cholesterol for 6 wk. Canola and soybean oils significantly lowered serum HDL cholesterol concentrations relative to butter. Canola oil, relative to butter, resulted in higher exogenous LCAT activity, and both soybean and canola oils significantly increased hepatic apo A-I and SR-B1 mRNA abundance. Butter, relative to margarine, coconut and soybean oils, significantly increased serum non-HDL cholesterol concentrations. Endogenous and exogenous LCAT, CETP, and PLTP activities did not differ in hamsters fed margarine or saturated fat diets, despite lower hepatic LCAT, apo A-I, and SR-B1 mRNA abundance, suggesting that changes in available substrate and/or modification to the LCAT protein may have been involved in lipoprotein changes. These results suggest that lower HDL cholesterol concentrations, as a result of canola and soybean oil feeding, may not be detrimental due to increases in components involved in the reverse cholesterol transport process in these hamsters and may retard the progression of atherosclerosis.""Dorfman, S.

It is established that high-fat saturated diets, relative to low-fat diets, induce adiposity and whole-body insulin resistance. Here, we test the hypothesis that markers of an obese, prediabetic state (fatty liver, visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance) are also worsened with provision of a low-fat diet containing elaidic acid (18: 1t), the predominant trans-fatty acid isomer found in the human food supply. Male 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a 10% trans-fatty acid enriched (LF-trans) diet for 8 weeks. At baseline, 3 and 6 weeks, in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MR) assessed intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps (week 8) determined whole-body and tissuespecific insulin sensitivity followed by high-resolution ex vivo (1)H-NMR to assess tissue biochemistry. Rats fed the LF-trans diet were in positive energy balance, largely explained by increased energy intake, and showed significantly increased visceral fat and liver lipid accumulation relative to the low-fat control diet. Net glycogen synthesis was also increased in the LF-trans group. A reduction in glucose disposal, independent of IMCL accumulation was observed in rats fed the LF-trans diet, whereas in rats fed a 45% saturated fat (HF-sat) diet, impaired glucose disposal corresponded to increased IMCL(TA). Neither diet induced an increase in IMCL(soleus). These findings imply that trans-fatty acids may alter nutrient handling in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle and that the mechanism by which trans-fatty acids induce insulin resistance differs from diets enriched with saturated fats.""Downs, S.

Methods The Medline, Embase and Cinahl databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles examining the effect of TFA policies. In addition, the first 20 pages of Google searches were examined for articles from the grey literature. A study was included if: (i) it was empirical and conducted in a ""real-world"" setting (i.e. modelling studies were excluded); (ii) it examined a TFA policy involving, for example, labelling, voluntary limits or bans; and (iii) it examined a policy's effect on TFA levels in food, people's diets, blood or breast milk. Findings Twenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria: 5 involved voluntary self-regulation; 8, labelling alone; 4, labelling and voluntary limits; 5, local bans and 4, national bans. Overall, the TFA content of food decreased with all types of policy intervention. In general, saturated fat levels increased or decreased, depending on the product type, and total fat content remained stable. National and local bans were most effective at eliminating TFAs from the food supply, whereas mandatory TFA labelling and voluntary TFA limits had a varying degree of success, which largely depended on food category. Conclusion Policies aimed at restricting the TFA content of food were associated with significant reductions in TFA levels, without increasing total fat content.

The very long-chain (20 or 22 carbon atoms) omega-3 fatty acids are mostly found in fatty fish and fish oils. The omega-3 fatty acids are essential and may act as precursors for eicosanoids, altering membrane fluidity or binding to transcription factors. Dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids reduces plasma concentration of triglycerides, probably by decreasing hepatic secretion of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and by increasing catabolism of chylomicrons. In addition, lipid peroxidation of omega-3 fatty acids may take place, with good and bad consequences. As the number of double bonds is high, the omega-3 fatty acids may easily react with oxygen radicals. We performed studies where 5 g/day of very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids was given as a supplement for four months along with vitamin E, whereas control groups received similar amounts of other oils. The unsaturation index was higher in fatty acids of LDL from individuals exposed to omega-3 fatty acids, and the amounts of cholesteryl esters and total lipids were lower compared with control LDL, whereas similar electrophoretic mobility and apolipoprotein B structure were observed. There was a decrease in the melting temperature of cholesteryl esters in omega-3 fatty acid-enriched LDL, but no change in the susceptibility of LDL to Cu2+ catalyzed lipid peroxidation, as measured by changes in amounts of lipid peroxides or in the uptake of LDL im macrophages. These data have been verified by others, whereas three publications reported that fish oil supplementation was associated with increased sings of lipid peroxidation. Recently it has been shown that peroxidation of LDL by white blood cells might be reduced by increased cellular content of omega-3 fatty acids. In conclusion, the susceptibility of LDL to in vitro peroxidation may be increased with dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids, unless adequate amounts of antioxidants are provided. Reduced intake of foods with high content of saturated fatty acids (fatty milk products, meat, hard margarines) and increased intake of foods providing high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (fatty fish) and antioxidants (fruits, vegetables) are recommended. These precautions will most likely promote reduced incidence of coronary artery disease, inflammatory diseases and certain forms of cancer.""Drogan, D., et al. (2007). ""A food pattern predicting prospective weight change is associated with risk of fatal but not with nonfatal cardiovascular disease."" Journal of Nutrition 137(8): 1961-1967."	2	"Recently, a food pattern predictive for prospective weight change was identified within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort. Given the possible impact of weight change on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, we examined the association between the above mentioned food pattern and risk of CVD. The analyzed food pattern was defined by a high consumption of whole-grain bread, fruits, fruit juices, grain flakes and/or cereals, and raw vegetables, and a low consumption of processed meat, butter, high-fat cheese, margarine, and meat other than poultry. The associations between quartiles of the food pattern score and CVD morbidity and mortality were examined in 26,238 subjects of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort using a Cox's Proportional Hazards model for competing risks. During 6.4 y of follow-up, 379 incident cases of CVD were identified, of which 68 were fatal Events. The food pattern was not associated with risk of nonfatal CVD. After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratios for fatal CVD across increasing quartiles of the score were 1.00, 0.85, 0.31, and 0.47, respectively (P for trend = 0.016). The association of the food pattern with CVD risk differed between fatal and nonfatal events (P for difference = 0.05). These findings from a large German cohort indicate that a food pattern predicting prospective weight change may be associated with the risk of fatal CVD.""Du, Z. Y., et al. (2010). ""Dissimilar Properties of Vaccenic Versus Elaidic Acid in beta-Oxidation Activities and Gene Regulation in Rat Liver Cells."" Lipids 45(7): 581-591."	0	"Vaccenic acid (trans-11-C(18:1)) chemically resembles elaidic acid (trans-9-C(18:1)) which is assumed to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and thus could exert similar effects. Possible different oxidation rates of vaccenic versus elaidic acid were checked in muscles and liver, and through related gene expression in normal rat liver cells. In hepatic mitochondria, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I exhibited comparable activity rates with both trans-isomers. CPT II activity was 30% greater (P < 0.05) with vaccenic than with elaidic acid as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) or acyl-CoAs. Activity of the first beta-oxidation step was similar between the isomers in all the tissue slices and liver extracts assayed. Respiration rates were comparable with both trans-isomers as NEFAs in various liver extracts, but were 30% greater (P < 0.05) with vaccenoyl-CoA than with elaidoyl-CoA in liver mitochondria. Vaccenic acid was oxidised 25% more (P < 0.05) by liver peroxisomes than elaidic acid. In hepatocytes cultured with trans- and corresponding cis-C(18:1) isomers, gene expression of CPT I, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase was at least 100% increased (P < 0.05), but was unchanged with vaccenic acid, relative to controls. In conclusion, the position and geometry of the double bonds in acyl chains are suggested to confer on vaccenic and elaidic acid specific biochemical properties that might differently affect their fates in tissues.""Du, Z.

The possibility that trans-9 and vaccenic acid (trans-11-C-18:1 or trans-11), its positional isomer, were biochemically equivalent and interchangeable compounds, was investigated by reference to their cis-isomers through esterification-related activities using rat liver cells and subcellular fractions. In hepatocytes, both trans-C-18:1 were incorporated to the same extent in triacylglycerols, but trans-9 was more esterified than trans-11 into phospholipids (P < 0.05). Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in microsomes was lower with trans-11 than with trans-9, while this activity in mitochondria was similar to 40% greater with trans-11 than with trans-9 (P < 0.05). Activity of 2-lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase in microsomes was of comparable extent with both trans isomers, but activity of 2-lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase was significantly greater with trans-9 than with trans-11 at P < 0.01. Lipoproteins secreted by hepatocytes reached equivalent levels in the presence of any isomers, but triacylglycerol production was more elevated with trans-11 than with trans-9 at P < 0.05. Cholesterol efflux from previously labelled hepatocytes was lower with trans-11 than with trans-9. When these cells were exposed to either trans-C-18:1, the gene expression of proteins involved in fatty acid esterification and lipoprotein synthesis was unaffected, which indicates that the biochemical differences essentially depended on enzyme/substrate affinities. On the whole, vaccenic and elaidic acid were shown to incorporate cell phospholipids unequally, at least in vitro, which suggests they can differently affect lipid metabolic pathways in normal cells.""Dugan, M.

Subcutaneous fat composition of youthful and mature Canadian beef: emphasis on individual conjugated linoleic acid and trans-18:1 isomers. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 88: 591-599. A comprehensive evaluation of the fatty acid composition of subcutaneous adipose tissue from beef cattle produced in western Canada was undertaken to determine if the current Canadian grading system is able to distinguish classes of animals with value added potential due to their fatty acid composition. Grades included youthful Canadian Yield Grade 1 A/AA beef, under (YUTM) and over (YOTM) 30 mo of age and the four mature grades (D 1, D2, D2 and 134). Subcutaneous fat between the l2th and 13th ribs over the longissimus muscle was obtained from 18-21 animals per grade. Fatty acids were analyzed using a combination of silver-ion HPLC and GC with a highly polar 100 In column. There were no differences in total trans-18:1 content amongst grades, but adipose tissue from grade D1, D2 and D4 had more 11t-18:1 than YUTM (P < 0.05), whereas adipose tissue from YUTM carcasses had more 10t-18:1 than all other grades (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue from YUTM carcasses also had less total CLA (P < 0.05) than the D grades, mainly due to a lower level of 9c,11t-CLA, but they had slightly more 7t,9c-CLA and 10t,12c-CLA (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue from YOTM and D grades contained more n-3 fatty acids relative to YUTM (0.56% vs. 0.29%; P < 0.05) and lower n-6:n-3 ratios (P < 0.05). Overall, older animals (YOTM and D grades) had adipose tissue compositions with higher levels of fatty acids with reported health benefits. Taken together, these higher levels may provide opportunities for value added marketing if regulatory authorities allow claims for their enrichment based on demonstrated health benefits. Higher concentrations of beneficial fatty acids, however, need to be considered within the context of the complete fatty acid profile and it would be important to demonstrate their advantages in the presence of relatively high levels of saturated fatty acids.""Dugan, M.

Trans fatty acids are found naturally in foods, particularly in those derived from ruminant animals, such as beef and dairy cattle. Over the past few decades, human consumption of trans fatty acids has increased, but this has been mainly from products containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. The correlation of trans fatty acid consumption with diseases such as coronary heart disease has been cause for concern, and led to recommendations to reduce their consumption. Trans fatty acids, however, have differing effects on human health. Therefore, in foods produced from ruminant animals, it is important to know their trans fatty acid composition, and how to enrich or deplete fatty acids that have positive or negative health effects. This review will cover the analysis of trans fatty acids in beef, their origin, how to manipulate their concentrations, and give a brief overview of their health effects.""Eady, S., et al. (2011).

A total of eighty mildly hypercholesterolaemic (total blood cholesterol level >= 5 and <= 7.5 mmol/l with a serum TAG level of <= 4.5 mmol/l) individuals were randomised into two groups (n 40). Group 1 consumed spread only daily for 4 weeks. They were randomised to consume 20 g RBO spread (RBOS), 20 g standard spread (SS) or 20 g phytosterol-enriched spread (PS). After a 4-week period, individuals changed to the next randomised treatment until all three treatments had been consumed. Group 2 consumed spread plus oil daily for 4 weeks. They consumed 20 g RBOS plus 30 ml RBO, 20 g SS plus 30 ml sunflower oil or 20 g RBOS. Blood samples were collected for the analysis of lipid parameters, and 3 d diet records were collected.

Attendees represented the agriculture and oilseed industry and oil processing, food manufacturing, food service, government, food technology, and health and nutrition disciplines. Presentations included food science behind fatty acid technology, the health science of dietary fatty acids, alternatives to trans fatty acids, and the use of alternatives in food manufacturing and food service. The reduction of trans fatty acids in the food supply is a complex issue involving interdependent and interrelated stakeholders. Actions to reduce trans fatty acids need to carefully consider both intended and unintended consequences related to nutrition and public health. The unintended consequence of greatest concern is that fats and oils high in saturated fats, instead of the healthier unsaturated fats, might be used to replace fats and oils with trans fatty acids. Many different options of alternative oils and fats to replace trans fatty acids are available or in development. Decisions on the use of these alternatives need to consider availability, health effects, research and development investments, reformulated food quality and taste, supply-chain management, operational modifications, consumer acceptance, and cost. The conference demonstrated the value of collaboration between the food industry and health and nutrition professionals, and this conference model should be used to address other food development, processing, and/or technology issues.""Egert, S., et al.

To this end, a controlled parallel study was conducted in 74 healthy normolipidemic men and women aged 19-43 y. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions and consumed a total intake of 4.4 g/d ALA (ALA group), 2.2 g/d EPA (EPA group), and 2.3g/d DHA (DHA group) for 6 wk. Fatty acid ethyl esters were incorporated into margarines, which replaced the participant's normal spread. The ALA, EPA, or DHA intake led to a significant enrichment of the LDL with the respective (n-3) fatty acid. In addition, LDL EPA contents in the ALA group increased by 36% (P < 0.05) with no changes in LDL DHA. The EPA intervention led to an additional enrichment with DHA (24%; P < 0.001), whereas the DHA intervention further increased the amount of EPA (249%; P < 0.001). ALA, EPA, or DHA intake did not affect fasting serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol, but fasting serum triacylglycerol concentrations significantly decreased in the EPA (-0.14 mmol/L) and DHA (-0.30 mmol/L) interventions and also in the ALA intervention (-0.17 mmol/L). DHA intake significantly increased serum HDL cholesterol, whereas no changes were found with ALA or EPA intake.

The total intakes of ALA, EPA, and DHA were 4.4, 2.2, and 2.3 g/d, respectively. Consuming EPA increased the erythrocyte proportion of EPA (394%) and the omega-3 index (sum of EPA and DHA, 38%). Consumption of DHA increased erythrocyte DHA (91%), the omega-3 index (98%), and EPA (137%). The omega-3 index increased to a significantly greater extent in the DHA group than in the EPA group. ALA did not increase erythrocyte EPA or the omega-3 index. We found no change in plasma uric acid or antioxidant capacity in any of the groups. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) increased with the EPA and DHA interventions. All 3 interventions decreased erythrocyte linoleic acid hydroperoxides but did not affect their MDA concentrations. In conclusion, the intake of both isolated EPA and DHA incorporated into margarine resulted in an enhanced incorporation of EPA and DHA into erythrocytes. our findings indicate that DHA is quantitatively superior to EPA in view of the EPA+DHA tissue incorporation and also that 4 g/d ALA is not sufficient to increase the omega-3 index over a 6-wk period.

All milk samples were analyzed for fatty acid (FA) content, with the farming system type, herd production level, and nutritional factors affecting the FA composition investigated by use of mixed model analyses. Models were constructed for saturated fatty acids, the ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to monounsaturated fatty acids, total n-3 FA, total n-6 FA, conjugated linoleic acid, and vaccenic acid. The ratio of n-6: n-3 FA in both organic and conventional milk was also compared. Organic milk had a higher proportion of PUFA to monounsaturated fatty acids and of n-3 FA than conventional milk, and contained a consistently lower n-6: n-3 FA ratio (which is considered beneficial) compared with conventional milk. There was no difference between organic and conventional milk with respect to the proportion of conjugated linoleic acid or vaccenic acid. A number of factors other than farming system were identified which affected milk FA content including month of year, herd average milk yield, breed type, use of a total mixed ration, and access to fresh grazing. Thus, organic dairy farms in the United Kingdom produce milk with a higher PUFA content, particularly n-3 FA, throughout the year. However, knowledge of the effects of season, access to fresh grazing, or use of specific silage types could be used by producers to enhance the content of beneficial FA in milk.""Eloranta, A.

Nutrient intake and meal pattern were measured by food records, and food intake and socioeconomic characteristics were assessed by questionnaires. Results: Intakes of saturated fat, sucrose and salt were higher, and intakes of vitamin D, iron and fibre and unsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio lower than recommended. Less than 5% of children consumed vegetables, fruit and berries as recommended. Children with highest parental education more likely ate fish (odds ratio (OR) 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-4.54), fibre-rich bread (OR 5.06, 95% CI 1.80-14.29) and main meals (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.34-4.83), but less likely used soft margarine (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.94) as recommended than children with lowest parental education.

Methods: The experiments were conducted at the laboratories of University of Dumlupinar, Kutahya, Turkey and Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey between November 2002 and December 2003. The animals were randomly divided into 5 groups of 30 and fed dietary butter, margarine, olive oil, sunflower oil or corn oil for 7 weeks. Liver malondialdehyde level, blood superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx), serum vitamin E, and total antioxidant (AOA) levels were measured to determine the effects of the dietary oils on lipid peroxidation. Results: No significant differences were observed in SOD and GPx activities, or vitamin E and AOA levels between the experimental groups. However, the results indicated that the corn oil feeding caused significant increases in liver malondialdehyde (a genotoxic by product of lipid peroxidation) level as compared with the other oils. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that corn oil feeding increases lipid peroxidation significantly and thus may raise the susceptibility of tissues to free radical oxidative damage.""Erkkila, A.

Diet-Lipid associations established in clinical trials have in general been weak or nonexistent in cross-sectional studies within a population. Our objective was to analyze the dietary associates of serum lipids in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) not using lipid-lowering medication. Methods. Patients with coronary bypass grafting (n = 49), balloon angioplasty (n = 46), acute myocardial infarction (n = 79), and acute myocardial ischemia (n 79) participated in a survey (EUROASPIRE). Patients were selected from hospital records at least 6 months after hospitalization. Diet was assessed by a food record, a short questionnaire, and fatty acid composition of serum cholesteryl esters (CE). Results. Neither the intake of total fat nor that of saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fatty acids was associated with serum lipids. Use of soft margarine on bread (though not in cooking or baking) and high intake of fiber and cereal products were associated with low total cholesterol. Linoleic acid in CE was inversely associated with total cholesterol and triglycerides, and eicosapentaenoic acid was inversely associated with triglycerides and positively associated with HDL cholesterol. Conclusions. In the present study use of soft margarine on bread (though not in cooking or baking) and high intake of fiber and cereal products were associates of lowered serum cholesterol concentrations in CHD patients. Fatty acid composition of CE reflected dietary fatty acid intake involved in cholesterol lowering better than food records.

These products may (1) have an additive effect to the effect that a drug has in reducing risk factors associated with certain conditions, (2) contribute to improve risk factors associated with the condition, other than the risk factor that the drug is dealing with, or (3) reduce drug-associated side effects, for example, by restoring depleted compounds or by reducing the necessary dose of the drug. Possible advantages compared with a multidrug therapy are lower drug costs, fewer side effects and increased adherence. In the present review we have focused on the support of statin therapy using functional foods or dietary supplements containing plant sterols and/or stanols, soluble dietary fibre, n-3 PUFA or coenzyme Q(10). We conclude that there is substantial evidence that adding plant sterols and/or stanols to statin therapy further reduces total and LDL-cholesterol by roughly 6 and 10%, respectively. Adding n-3 PUFA to statin therapy leads to a significant reduction in plasma TAG of at least 15%. Data are insufficient and not conclusive to recommend the use of soluble fibre or coenzyme Q(10) in patients on statin therapy and more randomised controlled trials towards these combinations are warranted. Aside from the possible beneficial effects from functional foods or dietary supplements on drug therapy, it is important to examine possible (negative) effects from the combination in the long term, for example, in post-marketing surveillance studies. Moreover, it is important to monitor whether the functional foods and dietary supplements are taken in the recommended amounts to induce significant effects.""Eussen, S., et al. (2011).

Phytosterols/-stanols were given only to persons who were eligible for use according to their 10-year absolute risk of fatal cardiovascular disease (SCORE-risk). Intake levels and discontinuation rates as observed in daily practice were included in the model.

Estimates of intakes are approximations based on limited data and problematic analytic techniques. Major contributors in the diet are fried and baked foods and margarine, in which partially hydrogenated vegetable oils may replace fat sources richer in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Consumption of trans fatty acids in the United States has been relatively constant, and new food technologies are yielding decreases in the trans fatty acid content of commercially prepared foods. When intake of trans fatty acids (as hydrogenated fat) is compared with that of saturated fat, total and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations in blood are lower, but both trans fats and saturated fats increase total and LDL concentrations when compared with cis fatty acids or native unhydrogenated fat. Epidemiologic data are conflicting with respect to cardiovascular disease outcomes. We cannot conclude that the intake of trans fatty acids is a risk factor for coronary heart disease nor can we expect that substituting trans- for cia-containing fats will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Few rigorous studies have dealt with biomedical effects of trans fatty acids and possible mechanisms relevant to human health and diseases. The nutrition labeling issue is unresolved. The options, recommendations, and research suggestions in this report should outline for nutrition scientists the database needed before any new dietary recommendations or changes in nutrition policy concerning trans fatty acids can be made. The debate about trans fatty acids should not detract from dietary recommendations to limit the intake of saturated fat and total fat.""Fernandez-Michel, S. G., et al. (2008).

Some evidences also suggests a positive correlation between TFA intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given the high prevalence of CVD in Mexico, it is important to promote that good nutrition begins in infancy. Due to CVD, it is believed that TFA consumption developed countries has decreased. In Mexico, there are no Current data on the amount of TFA intake in children and teenagers. But it is believed that the increase in snacks consumption is a source of TFA high levels in these groups.

However, trans fatty acids are not a homogeneous group of molecules, and less is known about the health effects of consuming diets containing vaccenic acid (VA), a positional and geometric isomer of oleic acid, the predominant trans isomer in ruminant fats. The presence of VA in industrial trans fats has raised the question of whether VA produces the same adverse health effects as industrially produced trans fats. VA is also the major trans fat in ruminant fats, and questions have arisen as to whether consuming this trans fat has the same effects on health risk. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the published studies in humans, animals, and cell lines. Epidemiological, but not rodent, studies suggest that VA intake or serum concentrations may be associated with increased cancer risk. However, epidemiological, clinical, and rodent studies to date have not demonstrated a relationship with heart or cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, or inflammation. VA is the only known dietary precursor of c9, t11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), but recent data suggest that consumption of this trans fat may impart health benefits beyond those associated with CLA.""Filip, S., et al.

Prospective epidemiological and case-control studies support a major role of TFAs in the risk of cardiovascular disease. In the partially hydrogenated soybean oil, which is the major source of TFAs worldwide, the main isomer is trans-10 C18:1. In the European countries with the highest TFA intake (the Netherlands and Norway), consumption of partially hydrogenated fish oils was common until the mid-1990s, after which they were omitted from the dietary fat intake. These partially hydrogenated fish oils included a variety of very long-chain TFAs. Recent findings from Asian countries (India and Iran) have indicated a very high intake of TFAs from partially hydrogenated soybean oil (4 % of energy). Thus TFAs appear to be a particular problem in developing countries, where soybean oil is used. In 2003, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a final ruling that required food manufacturers to list the TFAs in their foods on the nutritional facts label. One way to produce 'zero' levels of TFAs is the trans-esterification reaction between vegetable oils and solid fatty acids, like C8:0, C12:0, C14:0 and C16:0.""Filip, V., et al. (2003).

We aimed to investigate the association between habitual diet as a modifiable risk factor and relevant serum metabolites. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 2380 EPIC-Potsdam participants. Intake of 45 food groups was assessed by food frequency questionnaire and concentrations of 127 serum metabolites were measured by targeted metabolomics. Reduced rank regression was used to find dietary patterns that explain the maximum variation of metabolites. RESULTS: In the multivariable-adjusted model, the proportion of explained variation by habitual diet was ranked as follows: acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines (5.7%), sphingomyelins (5.1%), diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (4.4%), lyso-phosphatidylcholines (4.1%), acylcarnitines (3.5%), amino acids (2.2%) and hexose (1.6%). A pattern with high intake of butter and low intake of margarine was related to acylcarnitines, acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines and hydroxy-sphingomyelins, particularly with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid side chains. A pattern with high intake of red meat and fish and low intake of whole-grain bread and tea was related to hexose and phosphatidylcholines. A pattern consisting of high intake of potatoes, dairy products and cornflakes particularly explained methionine and branched chain amino acids. Dietary patterns related to type 2 diabetes-relevant metabolites included high intake of red meat and low intake of whole-grain bread, tea, coffee, cake and cookies, canned fruits and fish. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns characterized by intakes of red meat, whole-grain bread, tea and coffee were linked to relevant metabolites and could be potential targets for chronic disease prevention.""Floris, R., et al.

Using gas chromatography, the composition of bovine milkfat in farm sampling trials during various periods of the year was determined: pasture feeding (August 1998 and September 1999); barn feeding (April 1999); and the transition period (May 1999). In addition, the effect of the various types of silage included in winter diets on the composition of the milkfat was examined. In this latter experiment, three groups were selected from an actual situation in Dutch agricultural practice: herds fed on a diet with grass silage, herds fed on a diet with maize silage, and herds fed on a diet with both grass and maize silage. A clear seasonal effect on the CLA content of the milkfat was observed. The CLA content was highest (0.73 and 0.76 mol%) during pasture feeding and lowest (0.34 mol%) during barn feeding (winter). In the transition period, an intermediate CLA content was found (0.52 mol%). In the second study, the remarkable effect of the type of silage on the level of CLA in bovine milkfat was observed. When a mixture of grass and maize silage was fed, the amount of CLA (0.25 mol%) was lower than when either grass (0.38 mol%) or maize silage (0.35 mol%) was fed. This study indicates that it is possible to influence the level of CLA during the period of barn feeding by changing the type of silage that is fed.""Fouad, F. M., et al. (1998).

Butter lost a sizable portion of its market share due to controversies associated with its cholesterol content and high percentage of long-chain saturated fatty acids. Accordingly, the use of vegetable oils and their chemically manipulated counterparts such as those produced by partial hydrogenation or interestrification increased proportionally. However, beginning in 1940, researchers developed several procedures such as temperature-controlled crystallization, refractionation of crystallized butter oil solids, and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction to improve the acceptance of butter oil. Others proposed preparation of synthetic substitutes such as sucrose polyesters to reduce intestinal absorption of fatty acids, thus reducing caloric intake with concomitant reduction in serum cholesterol.

We investigated the impact of membrane incorporation of TFA on cholesterol efflux by exposing J774 mouse macrophages or human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) to media enriched or not (standard medium) with industrially produced elaidic (trans-9 18:1) acid, naturally produced vaccenic (trans-11 18:1) acid (34 h, 70 mu M) or palmitic acid. In J774 macrophages, elaidic and palmitic acid, but not vaccenic acid, reduced ABCA1-mediated efflux by similar to 23% without affecting aqueous diffusion, SR-BI or ABCG1-mediated pathways, and this effect was maintained in cholesterol-loaded cells. The impact of elaidic acid on the ABCA1 pathway was weaker in cholesterol-normal HMDM, but elaidic acid induced a strong reduction of ABCA1-mediated efflux in cholesterol-loaded cells (-36%). In J774 cells, the FA supplies had no impact on cellular free cholesterol or cholesteryl ester masses, the abundance of ABCA1 mRNA or the total and plasma membrane ABCA1 protein content. Conversely, TFA or palmitic acid incorporation induced strong modifications of the membrane FA composition with a decrease in the ratio of (cis-monounsaturated FA + polyunsaturated FA):(saturated FA + TFA), with elaidic and vaccenic acids representing each 20% and 13% of the total FA composition, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that cellular ATP was required for the effect of elaidic acid, suggesting that it contributes to atherogenesis by impairing ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages, likely by decreasing the membrane fluidity, which could thereby reduce ATPase activity and the function of the transporter.

However, using plant sterol (not plant stanol) enriched products elevates serum plant sterol concentrations in humans. This may be unwanted because health effects of elevated serum plant sterol concentrations are still controversial. Within postlaunch monitoring of functional foods, we compared serum plant sterol and plant stanol concentrations among users of plant sterol (n = 67) or plant stanol (n = 13) enriched margarines with those of matched nonusers (n = 81) in the ongoing Dutch Doetinchem cohort study.

The first part deals comprehensively with concentrations of the human sex steroid hormones progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol estrone, and testosterone in animal and vegetable food. The dietary in take of steroid hormones (10 mu g/day progesterone, 0.1 mu g/day estrogens, and 0.05 mu g/day testosterone) is negligible compared to the human endogenous hormone synthesis. The second part addresses the phytoestrogens (isoflavones, coumestans, other bioflavonoids, lignans, phytosterols), which occur in food in much higher amounts than steroid hormones. Therefore, they can cause hormonal effects although their estrogen equivalents (relative to 17 beta-estradiol) are estimated to be 10(-2)-10(-4). These effects can be beneficial or adverse, depending on the effectiveness and amount of the ingested hormone agonist, synergistic, and antagonistic effects with other dietary or endogenous hormones, interactions with other dietary compounds (e.g. fiber and fat intake), and the hormonal status of the individual. The review also summarizes the occurrence of steroid hormone precursors and of other growth-related hormones in food (corticosteroids, indole-3-carbinol, protein hormones). It ends with the presentation of residues and contaminants of fungal or anthropogenic origin (mycoestrogens, pesticides, plastic or food additives, industrial chemicals) which have also shown hormonal or hormone-blocking properties.""Fuentes, F., et al.

Pharmacological treatment and diet are both essential for the management of FH. Foods rich in plant sterols ( PS) may play an important role in the treatment of patients with these disorders. Objective: To test the effect of the intake of PS on low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) concentration, endothelial function (EF) and LDL particle size in 30 patients with FH. Design: Randomized and crossover dietary intervention study. Setting: Tertiary outpatient care. Subjects: Thirty- eight were recruited, but only 30 were subjected to four low- fat dietary intervention periods, each of 4 weeks. Methods: Each intervention had a different content of cholesterol ( <150 or 300 mg/ day) and sitosterol ( <1 or 2 g/ day). Lipid response, EF and LDL particle size were analysed after the intervention. Results: Plasma sitosterol/ cholesterol ratio was higher during both plant sterol- rich periods than during the low plant sterols periods. Basal sitosterol concentrations predicted the LDL- cholesterol response during the intake of plant sterol- enriched diets. The change in LDL- cholesterol was significantly greater in subjects in the upper and intermediate tertiles of basal plasma sitosterol concentrations ( - 21 +/- 8 mg/dl, P 0.03; - 19 +/- 7 mg/ dl, P= 0.04, respectively) than in subjects in the lower tertile ( 875 mg/ dl) when they changed from a low cholesterol diet to a low cholesterol plus plant sterol diet.

CLA accumulated once, and then decreased with time. The numbers of LA-hydrogenating bacteria in the intestines appeared to decrease greatly with the ages of dogs and cats. As a major product of LA biohydrogenation, trans-vaccenic acid (t-VA) was identified. Most CLA and t-VA were readily solubilized by shaking the incubation mixture with bovine serum albumin, which strongly supports the presumption that CLA and t-VA are mostly formed on the outer surface of cell membrane, or excreted to the outer cell surface. This result suggests that CLA and t-VA can readily be absorbed through the large intestines. Triacylglycerol and phospholipid were shown to be hydrolyzed to free fatty acids by fecal bacteria, which is critical for biohydrogenation to occur, because esterified LA is not hydrogenated. However, since the ability of intestinal bacteria to produce CLA is probably low, it is desirable to augment CLA production.""Fukuda, S., et al. (2005).

Journal of General and Applied Microbiology 51(2): 105-113."	0	"A new strain of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (TH1) that has high potential to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was isolated. Strain TH1 had higher LA isomerase (LA-I) activity, and was much more tolerant to linoleic acid (LA) than other strains examined. However, high CLA reductase (CLA-R) activity resulted in the temporary accumulation of CLA and subsequent conversion to trans-vaccenic acid (t-VA). When LA was added to growing TH1 cultures in a solution with dimethylsulfoxide (LA/DMSO), CLA produced was greater than when LA was added in a mixture with bovine serum albumin (BSA). The number of viable cells decreased upon addition of LA/DMSO, but then increased as the CLA decreased upon its conversion to t-VA. This result suggests that B. fibrisolvens can resume growing by the removal of CLA from the cells. Most CLA was released from B. fibrisolvens cells by gentle washing with BSA, suggesting that CLA bound to the cells might be removed in the rumen and large intestine. Thus, CLA production by B. fibrisolvens in the digestive tract could be increased by a reduction in CLA-R activity without accompanying an overall decrease in the cell number of B. fibrisolvens. Fatty acids (FAs) with 18 carbon backbone inducted LA-I activity, whereas unsaturated FAs induced CLA-R activity, suggesting that FAs stimulate the synthesis of LA-I and CLA-R. Providing a diet with a low ratio of unsaturated to saturated FAs may favor CLA production.""Gagliardi, A. C. M., et al. (2009). ""NUTRITIONAL PROFILE OF FOODS WITH ZERO TRANS FATTY ACIDS CLAIM.""

Methods: This was a randomized, single-blind study where 53 metabolic syndrome subjects (62% women, mean age 54 years) received isocaloric servings of butter, no-trans-fat margarine or plant sterol margarine in addition to their usual diets for 5 weeks. The main outcome measures were plasma lipids, Apo, inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction markers (CRP, IL-6, CD40L or E-selectin), small dense LDL cholesterol concentrations and in vitro radioactive lipid transfer from cholesterol-rich emulsions to HDL. Difference among groups was evaluated by analysis of variance. Results: There was a significant reduction in Apo-B (-10.4 %, P = 0.043) and in the Apo-B/Apo-A-1 ratio (-11.1%, P = 0.034) with plant sterol margarine. No changes in plasma lipids were noticed with butter and no-trans-fat margarine. Transfer rates of lipids to HDL were reduced in the no-trans-fat margarine group: triglycerides -42.0%, (P<0.001 vs butter and sterol margarine) and free cholesterol -16.2% (P = 0.006 vs sterol margarine). No significant effects were noted on the concentrations of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction markers among the groups. Conclusions: In free-living subjects with the metabolic syndrome consumption of plant sterol and no-trans-fat margarines within recommended amounts reduced, respectively, Apo-B concentrations and the ability of HDL to accept lipids.

Long chain n-3PUFA intake in the Western countries, including Australia, has been shown to be inadequate. This is largely due to the fact that the Western populations do not eat seafood on a regular basis because of its cost and availability, and many individuals do not like the flavor/taste/odor of seafood. Foods fortified with long chain n-3PUFA could play an important role in meeting the demands for optimal health. Marine n-3PUFA are not likely to compete with saturated, monounsaturated, and n-6PUFA as a major source of dietary fat; however, increasing the intake of foods containing marine n-3PUFA is an important strategy for the prevention of chronic illnesses. Recent developments in food technology allow fortification of foods, such as bread, dairy products, eggs, pasta, biscuits, margarines, and other spreads, without the undesirable fish odor/taste and with reasonable shelf life. There is a need to increase the amount of long chain n-3PUFA consumed per serve and optimize their bioavailability.

American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 67(1): 25-30."	0	We compared fatty acid amounts in adipose tissue with fatty acid intake calculated from 2 separate weeks of diet recording and two food-frequency questionnaires for 140 participants in the Nurses' Health Study. Our results showed that the amounts of polyunsaturated and trans fatty acids in adipose tissue reflect dietary intake and confirm those of previous studies. The correlation between the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of adipose tissue and polyunsaturated fatty acid intake from the average of the two food-frequency questionnaires was 0.40; this correlation for trans fatty acids was also 0.40. Linolenic acid amounts in adipose tissue were also moderately correlated with intake from the average of the food-frequency questionnaires (r = 0.34). An estimate of trans fatty acid intake from vegetable sources correlated much more strongly with adipose trans fatty acids than did an estimate of trans fatty acids from animal sources. Adipose tissue aspirates can be used to indicate intake of exogenous fatty acids."Gatto, L. M., et al. (2001). ""Trans fatty acids and cholesterol metabolism: mechanistic studies in rats and rabbits fed semipurified diets."" International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition 52(5): 435-441."	2	"Studies were conducted in rabbits and rats to investigate the effects of diets rich in oleic (CIS diet), palmitic (SAT diet) and trans fatty acids (TRANS diet) on plasma lipids and lipoprotein metabolism. An important difference between these species is that rabbits possess plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity while rats are devoid of transfer activity. In the presence of dietary cholesterol (0.2% w/w) the change in plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration from baseline was significantly higher in rabbits fed the TRANS diet compared with those fed the CIS diet (P < 0.01). Despite this difference, the hepatic LDL-receptor activity was similar in all groups. Also, the fatty acid composition of hepatic phospholipids was affected by diet with lower proportion of palmitic (11%) and higher (19%) linoleic acid despite a similar content in the diet. These effects may represent the maintenance of membrane fluidity within narrow limits to ensure optimal function. The studies in rats showed that the plasma total cholesterol concentration was 20% lower (P < 0.01) in TRANS-fed rats compared with those fed the CIS diet. The results of an in vivo assay of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) suggested that the three diets gave rise to high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles with similar capacity to accept cellular cholesterol. The differential effects of dietary trans fatty acids in these animal models provide another line of evidence that reinforces the significant role of CETP activity in determining the distribution of plasma cholesterol in response to dietary trans fatty acids.""Gatto, L.

Rats fed the TRANS diet had lower plasma total cholesterol (P < 0.005) and non-HDL-cholesterol (non HDL-C) concentrations (P < 0.005) compared with their CIS-fed counterparts. Plasma HDL-C was highest in rats fed the SAT diet (P = 0.01). An in vivo assay of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) was performed whereby radiolabeled cholesterol was delivered to the liver as acetylated LDL and the reappearance of label into plasma and HDL was determined. Plasma radioactivity in TRANS-fed rats was lower than in their SAT-fed counterparts (P = 0.01), and consistent with the cholesterol distribution in plasma, the difference was due to lower [H-3]-cholesterol in lower density lipoproteins. Despite diet-induced differences in the cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations and fatty acid composition of HDL, the amount of label in HDL did not differ among groups, suggesting that consumption of these diets resulted in HDL populations with similar capacity to participate in RCT. The present findings suggest that dietary trans fatty acids regulate the metabolism of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in rats and that the effect may be masked in species possessing high plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. These results reinforce the important role of CETP activity in determining the distribution of plasma cholesterol in response to dietary trans fatty acids.""Gatto, L. M., et al. (2003).

Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether postprandial lipoprotein metabolism is affected by the consumption of trans fatty acids. Design: In a randomized crossover study, 19 healthy men consumed fatty meals that were identical except that 10% of energy was provided as trans 18:1 acids in the trans meal and as oleic acid in the cis meal. Results: The meals induced similar responses in plasma lipids. Cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) was activated after consumption of both meals (P < 0.0001); however, it was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal (280 129 compared with 219 +/- 116 nmol cholesteryl ester/mL plasma . 6 h; time X diet interaction: P < 0.0001). Plasma apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] concentrations remained constant; however, triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins formed 4 h after ingestion of the trans meal contained a higher concentration of apo(a) than did those formed after ingestion of the cis meal (48.9 +/- 6.6 compared with 39.6 +/- 5.4 U/L; P < 0.02). The change in CET and in the proportion of plasma apo(a) in the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein fractions correlated with indexes of alimentary lipemia. Conclusions: Consumption of meals high in trans fatty acids results in higher CET and postprandial lipoprotein concentrations enriched in apo(a) than does consumption of meals free of trans fatty acids. This study highlights the importance of double-bond configuration in determining postprandial lipoprotein composition.""Gebauer, S. K., et al. (2007).

It is not yet clear how specific TFA isomers vary in their biological activity and mechanisms of action. There is evidence of health benefits on some of the endpoints that have been studied for some animal TFA isomers, such as conjugated linoleic acid; however, these are not a major TFA source in the diet. Future research will bring clarity to our understanding of the biological effects of the individual TFA isomers. At this point, it is not possible to plan diets that emphasize individual TFA from animal sources at levels that would be expected to have significant health effects. Due to the multiple adverse effects of manufactured TFA, numerous agencies and governing bodies recommend limiting TFA in the diet and reducing TFA in the food supply. These initiatives and regulations, along with potential TFA alternatives, are presented herein.""Gebauer, S. K., et al. (2011).

The purpose of the current study is to determine whether consumption of TFA derived from different sources differentially affect risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The study was a randomized, crossover design, controlled-feeding intervention designed to compare the effects of the following diet treatments on risk factors of CVD: low TFA diet (base diet, 34% energy from fat; 0.1% energy from TFA), base diet with vaccenic acid (3.0% energy), base diet with mixed isomers of TFA from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (3.0% energy), and base diet with cis-9, trans-11 CLA (1.0% energy). The added energy from TFA replaced energy from stearic acid. Participants were required to be between the ages of 25 and 65 years, have a body mass index between 20 and 38 kg/m(2), total cholesterol <280 mg/dl, fasting triacylglycerol <300 mg/dl, fasting glucose <126 mg/dl, and blood pressure <160/100 mm Hg (controlled with certain medications). Of the 116 participants who were randomized, a total of 95 completed the intervention. Results from this study will be important in determining whether ruminant TFA and industrially produced TFA differentially affect markers of cardiovascular risk, in the context of a highly controlled feeding study.

American Heart Journal 159(4): 539-U556."	0	"Background Weekly fish consumption has been related to a lower risk of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and incident stroke in populations with a low fish intake. This relation has mainly been attributed to n-3 fatty acids in fish, that is, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It is at present unclear whether alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a n-3 fatty acid from vegetable origin, could also be protective against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). There is a need for food-based trials to establish the efficacy of low doses of n-3 fatty acids in CVD prevention. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of an additional daily intake of 400 mg of EPA + DHA and 2 g of ALA on CVD morbidity and mortality in free-living subjects with a history of myocardial infarction. Design The multicenter Alpha Omega Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design. Between May 2002 and December 2006, we enrolled a total of 4,837 men and women aged 60 through 80 who experienced a myocardial infarction within 10 years before entering the study. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 margarine spreads that were enriched with EPA + DHA and/or ALA, or placebo. Compliance was monitored via tub counts and assessment of n-3 fatty acids in plasma. Subjects were observed for 40 months for the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal CVD. Results The cohort was on average 69 years old at the start of the study and comprised 22% women. Subjects had their (last) myocardial infarction approximately 4 years before enrolment. Mean body mass index was 27.7 kg/m(2), and 17% smoked. Average serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 4.7 and 1.3 mmol/L, respectively, and 85% used statins. Mean blood pressure was 142/80 mm Hg, and most subjects were on antihypertensive medication (88%). Diabetes mellitus was reported by 17% of the subjects, and 7% reported a history of stroke. The overall mortality rate during the trial period was 23 per 1,000 person-years, with approximately 40% due to CVD. Current status Follow-up of the patients was completed in November 2009, and findings will be reported in the second part of 2010. (Am Heart J 2010; 159: 539-546. e2.)""Geleijnse, J. M., et al.

For alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) obtained from vegetable sources, the effect on cognitive decline is unknown. We examined the effect of n-3 fatty acid supplementation on cognitive decline in coronary heart disease patients. Methods: The analysis included 2911 coronary patients (78% men) aged 60 to 80 years who participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of n-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular diseases (Alpha Omega Trial). By using a 2 X 2 factorial design, patients were randomly assigned to margarines that provided 400 mg/d of EPA DHA, 2 g/d of ALA, both EPA DHA and ALA, or placebo for 40 months. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline and after 40 months. The effect of n-3 fatty acids on change in MMSE score was assessed using analysis of variance. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the effects on risk of cognitive decline, defined as a decrease of 3 or more points in MMSE score or incidence of dementia. Results: Patients in the active treatment groups had an additional intake of 384 mg of EPA DHA, 1.9 g of ALA, or both. The overall MMSE score in this cohort was 28.3 +/- 1.6 points, which decreased by 0.67 +/- 2.25 points during follow-up. Changes in MMSE score during intervention did not differ significantly between EPA DHA and placebo (-0.65 vs -0.65 points, P = .44) or between ALA and placebo (-0.60 vs -0.74 points, P = .12). The risk of cognitive decline was 1.03 (95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.26, P = .80) for EPA DHA (vs placebo) and 0.90 (0.74-1.10, P = .31) for ALA (vs placebo).

American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 80(3): 550-559."	0	"Public health recommendations for the US population in 1977 were to reduce fat intake to as low as 30% of calories to lower the incidence of coronary artery disease. These recommendations resulted in a compositional shift in food materials throughout the agricultural industry, and the fractional content of fats was replaced principally with carbohydrates. Subsequently, high-carbohydrate diets were recognized as contributing to the lipoprotein pattern that characterizes atherogenic dyslipidemia and hypertriacylglycerolemia. The rising incidences of metabolic syndrome and obesity are becoming commonihemes in the literature. Current recommendations are to keep saturated fatty acid, trans fatty acid, and cholesterol intakes as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet. In the face of such recommendations, the agricultural industry is shifting food composition toward lower proportions of all saturated fatty acids. To date, no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified. This review summarizes research findings and observations on the disparate functions of saturated fatty acids and seeks to bring a more quantitative balance to the debate on dietary saturated fat. Whether a finite quantity of specific dietary saturated fatty acids actually benefits health is not yet known. Because agricultural practices to reduce saturated fat will require a prolonged and concerted effort, and because the world is moving toward more individualized dietary recommendations, should the steps to decrease saturated fatty acids to as low as agriculturally possible not wait until evidence clearly indicates which amounts and types of saturated fatty acids are optimal?.""Ghafoorunissa (2008).

Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition 17: 212-215."	1	"Evidence indicates that dietary trans fatty acids (TFA) obtained from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVO) increase the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Studies have implicated TFA in increasing the risk and incidence of diabetes. Furthermore, TFA may compromise fetal and early infant growth and development. In rats, partial substitution of either linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) with saturated fatty acids (SFA, 6 en %) or SFA with TFA (3 en % from vanaspati) decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity, but these effects were greater in TFA group. Since a large proportion of Indian population is insulin resistant, the TFA content in Indian edible fats/oils and foods should be reduced. Vanaspati (PHVO) provides up to 40% TFA, is used in Indian cooking and in the preparation of commercially fried, processed, bakery, ready-to-eat and street foods. TFA in biscuits and sweets range 30-40 and 6-26% of total fatty acids respectively. There is no regulation on TFA content in vanaspati, bakery fats and shortenings. Reduction in Indian edible fats/oils and foods can be achieved by: a) specifying limits of TFA in vanaspati, bakery fats and shortenings by upgrading technology; b) advocating the substitution of natural plant oils containing lower percent of polyunsaturated fatty acids for PHVO. Indian edible oil industry needs to develop and adopt alternative technologies to produce zero TFA. Consumer education about negative health effects of TFA and providing food based guidelines to reduce TFA consumption in the entire population need to be actively pursued.""Ghahremanpour, F., et al.

To assess the association between adipose tissue levels of TFA, a biomarker of intake and the risk of CAD, we conducted a population-based case-control study. Methods: We studied 105 patients aged 30-73 years with angiographically proven coronary stenosis referred to Tehran Rajaee Cardiovascular Center, and 68 healthy subjects with no history of heart disease. Adipose tissue fatty acids were determined by gas liquid chromatography technique. Results: Total TFAs in adipose tissue were higher in the cases than controls (p < 0.05). When all the subjects were classified into the three groups by tertiles of TFA levels, significant differences (p < 0.01) in LDL cholesterol were found among the three groups. After adjusting for established risk factors and other confounders, the OR of the interquintile of total TFA and trans-18: 1 was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.0-1.8) and 1.32 (95% CI, 1.0-1.8), respectively. Conclusions: These findings suggest that dietary intake of TFA is associated with increase in the risk of CAD. Further, our results show that the high percentage of TFA in adipose tissue of the Iranian population is alarming and that more health policies regarding the TFA content of hydrogenated oil used in Iran should be established.

Vaccenic acid (VA) and elaidic acid (EA) are the predominant trans monoenes in ruminant fats and vegetable oil, respectively. Here, we investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by VA and EA on primary rat ventricular myofibroblasts (rVF). The MIT assay demonstrated that both VA and EA (200 mu M, 0-72 h) reduced cell viability in rVF (P<0.001). The FACS assay confirmed that both VA and EA induced apoptosis in rVF, and this was concomitant with elevation in cleaved caspase-9, -3 and -7, but not caspase-8. VA and EA decreased the expression ratio of Bcl2:Bax, induced Bax translocation to mitochondria and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi). BAX and BAX/BAK silencing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) inhibited VA and EA-induced cell death compared to the corresponding wild type cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that VA and EA also induced macroautophagosome formation in rVF, and immunoblot analysis confirmed the induction of several autophagy markers: LC3-beta lipidation, Atg5-12 accumulation, and increased beclin-1. Finally, deletion of autophagy genes, ATG3 and ATG5 significantly inhibited VA and EA-induced cell death (P<0.001). Our findings show for the first time that trans fat acid (TFA) induces simultaneous apoptosis and autophagy in rVF. Furthermore, TFA-induced autophagy is required for this pro-apoptotic effect.

Some data indicate that consumption of trans fatty acids increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In 1966-1969, 832 men from the Framingham Study, age 45-64 years and free of CHD, were administered a single 24-hour dietary recall, from which we estimated total daily margarine intake. We calculated CHD cumulative incidence rates and, using proportional hazards regression, CHD incidence rate ratios over 21 years of followup. Mean energy intake was 2,619 kcal; mean margarine intake was 1.8 (range 0-12) tsp per day. There were 267 incident cases of CHD. Age adjusted CHD cumulative incidence rose over categories of margarine intake, hut the increased risk was apparent only in the second half of the follow-up period. Adjusted for age and energy intake, the risk ratio for CHD for each increment of 1 teaspoon per day of margarine was 0.98 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-1.05] for the first 10 years of follow up and 1.10 (95% CI = 1.04-1.17) for follow-up years 11-21. Adjustment for total fat intake and for cigarette smoking, glucose intolerance, left ventricular hypertrophy, body mass index, blood pressure, physical activity, and alcohol intake did not materially change the results. Butter intake did not predict CHD incidence. These data offer modest support to the hypothesis that margarine intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.""Giltay, E. J., et al. (2011).

In a randomized, double-blind, controlled, cross-over study, 59 healthy normolipidaemic men consumed either Optimized or Standard rapeseed oils (20 g/d) and margarines (22 g/d) for 3 weeks.

Over the 3-week trial, Total-/HDL-cholesterol and LDL-/HDL-cholesterol were increased by 4% (p<0.05) with the Standard oil consumption whereas none of them rose with the Optimized rapeseed oil which increased the HDL-cholesterol and ApoA1 plasma content (+ 2%, NS and +3%, p<0.05 respectively). The effects observed on the plasma HDL-cholesterol levels (p = 0.059), the Total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio (p = 0.092), and on the ApoA1 concentrations (p = 0.060) suggest an improvement of the cholesterol profile with the Optimized rapeseed oil. Finally, the Optimized oil reduced the plasma content of LDLox (-6%, NS), this effect being significantly different from the Standard oil (p = 0.050). In conclusion, reasonable intake of an Optimized rapeseed oil resulting from innovative refining processes and enriched in cardioprotective micronutrients represent a relevant nutritional approach to prevent the risk of cardiovascular diseases by improving the cholesterol profile and reducing LDL oxidation.

Methods: We compared the proportions of TFAs and CLAs in the milk of rural Fulani in northern Nigeria who consume dairy products to that of women living in an urban center who consume little in the way of dairy products. Lactating Fulani women (n=41) and women residing in the city of Jos, Nigeria (n=41) were recruited into the study. We predicted that the milk of the Fulani pastoralists would contain higher amounts of TFAs and CLAs compared to their urban counterparts. Results: The mean total TFA proportions for the Fulani and urban women were 0.22% and 0.34%, respectively, and were not significantly different. The percentages of CLAs in milk fat were not different between rural and urban women (0.16% vs 0.14%). These TFA and CLA values were 4- to 10-fold lower than for milk of women elsewhere in the world. Conclusions: The percentages of TFAs and CLAs in milk were not different between rural and urban dwellers in northern Nigeria whose diets differ greatly in the amounts of dairy products they contain. However, the fact that the percentages of TFAs and CLAs in the milk of Nigerian women were much lower than the percentages reported from other parts of the world may have implications for the long-term growth and development of infants in the northern Nigeria and elsewhere in the Western Sahel.

Journal of Health Population and Nutrition 28(2): 159-166."	1	"The Fulani are semi-nomadic pastoralists of West Africa whose diet, culture, and economy are centred on cattle. Previous studies have shown that the Fulani of northern Nigeria derive 50% of their total calories from fat and 30% of their calories from milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter oil that contain significant amounts of trans fatty acids (TFAs), primarily vaccenic acid, which raise total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and lower high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). The study was conducted to know how the consumption of relatively large amounts of dairy products by adult Fulani affected the TFA content of their serum phospholipids. Blood samples were collected from 22 male and 29 female Fulani, aged 35-60 years, who were living in rural areas of Gombe state in northeastern Nigeria. The total serum phospholipid fraction was isolated, and its fatty acid composition was determined. Surprisingly, vaccenic acid was not detected, and three other TFAs-18:1-t6, 18:1-t9, and 18:2-t9,t12-together accounted for only 0.16% of the total fatty acid. The mean serum total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride concentrations of the subjects were within the normal range for populations in developed countries; however, at 32 mg/dL, the mean serum HDL-C concentration of the Fulani males was slightly below the lower limit of the reference range. No correlations were observed between the total TFA percentage or that of the three individual TFAs and any of the parameters of the serum lipid profile. These findings indicate that, with respect to TFAs at least, the fatty acid pattern of the serum phospholipids of Fulani pastoralists does not reflect the high TFA content of their traditional diet. Despite the consumption of rumenic acid-rich dairy products, for unknown reasons, the semi-nomadic Fulani manage to maintain a low level of TFAs in their blood and a relatively healthful serum lipid profile. While the mechanism that accounts for this disconnect between the consumption of TFAs by Fulani pastoralists and the proportion of TFAs in their serum phospholipids is obscure, possibilities include discrimination against nimenic acid during the process of triglyceride synthesis and chylomicron synthesis in the intestine and the preferential oxidation of TFAs by Fulani the people compared to other ethnic groups.""Gokce, R., et al.

A total of 150 1-day-old chicks were divided into 5 groups and selected as butter, margarine, sunflower oil. olive oil and corn oil groups. The oils were added to their chow as 5% (w/w) at the beginning and 7% at the end. After a period of 45 days, blood samples were obtained from the vena axillaris. Then, plasma levels of total cholesterol, HDL-C. HDL2-C, HDS-C. LDL-C, thiobarbutiric acid reactive substrates (TBARS) as malondialdehyde (MDA) and TxA(2) were measured, The results indicated that total cholesterol, HDL-C. HDL3-C and TxA(2) levels were highest in the butter group whereas HDL2-C was highest in the olive oil group. The lowest HDL2-C was in the margarine group and the second lowest level was in the butter group. TEARS levels were highest in the corn oil group, lowest in the butter group and increased in the order butter<margarine<olive oil<sunflower oil<corn oil. Our findings show that unsaturated fats added to the chow of chicks are more peroxidated in their blood than saturated ones. The effect of this peroxidation on the meat of chicks and on those who eat them is not known. On the other hand. in spite of the fact that the metabolism of lipids, lipoproteins and TxA(2) might be somewhat different from those in humans, these findings can be regarded as a guide for humans. It may be speculated that although unsaturated fats do not contain cholesterol they constitute a risk factor for many diseases including atherosclerosis, due to their low resistance to lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, although saturated fats constitute a risk factor for atherosclerosis due to their high cholesterol and saturated fatty acids contents, they are beneficial for humans due to their high resistance to lipid peroxidation. Therefore, in evaluating the consumption of fats, these 2 points must be taken into account In addition, olive oil is the most resistant oil to lipid peroxidation among unsaturated oils and the low level of HDL2-C in the margarine group is interesting with respect to atherosclerosis. Also, our unexpected finding which shows that TxA(2) production is higher in animals fed saturated fats than in those fed unsaturated ones needs to be investigated.""Golay, P. A., et al. (2009).

Journal of Aoac International 92(5): 1301-1309."	0	"To support labeling, claims, and authenticity of food products, industry needs reliable methods for the analysis of fatty acids, including trans fatty acids (TFA). In finished products, precise quantification of TFA can be problematic due to the occurrence of various positional and geometrical isomers originating from different sources, such as animal fats or processed vegetable oils and fats. The risk of underestimating TFA amounts is particularly high when inappropriate GC conditions are used. Complex sample preparation procedures involving purification of TFA isomers by silver ion chromatography have been well-documented and used for research purposes. However, in the food industry, time and cost constraints do not permit multiple analytical steps; therefore, streamlined methods are necessary. Direct methods include preparation of fatty acid methyl esters directly from food samples without prior extraction. The appropriate resolution is obtained using high-resolution GC with a highly polar 100 m capillary column, and quantification is achieved using experimentally determined response. We found that it is possible to quantify TFA in the range of 0.01 to 5.00 g/100 g of lipids in a wide range of food products. In addition, the use of direct transmethylation, response factors, and high-resolution GC allow accurate quantification of other fatty acids, including polyunsaturated and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.""Gong, Y.

Undesirable attributes of RDF included a lack of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and intermediate levels of trans fatty acids (TFA) compared to the other lipid sources. Decreasing the time and temperature of rendering decreased the TFA content in RDF.

We also aimed to investigate the link between serum lipids and cholesterol-lowering medication (statins) and hearing loss. The Blue Mountains Hearing Study is a population-based survey of age-related hearing loss. Hearing loss was measured in 2956 participants (aged >= 50 y) and was defined as the pure-tone average (PTA) of frequencies 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz > 25 dB hearing level (PTA(0.5-4kHz)). Dietary data were collected using a semiquantitative FFQ. After multivariable adjustment, the likelihood of prevalent hearing loss increased from the lowest (reference) to the highest quartile of dietary cholesterol intake (P-trend = 0.04). Among persons self-reporting statin use (n = 274), a 48% reduced odds of prevalent hearing loss was observed after multivariable adjustment [OR = 0.52 (95% CI = 0.29-0.93)]. Participants in the second and 3rd quartiles of dietary monounsaturated fat intake compared with those in the first quartile (reference) had a significantly reduced risk of hearing loss progression 5 y later [multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.39 (95% CI = 0.21-0.71)] and [OR = 0.51 (95% CI = 0.29-0.91)], respectively.

From a clinical perspective, there is a need to explore the effects of changing food and dietary patterns of individuals. The aim was to identify patterns of food choice in the context of a clinical weight loss trial. Cluster analysis based on reported serves of food groups revealed dietary patterns informative for the clinical setting. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cluster analysis was conducted using diet history data from two clinical trials at baseline, and outcomes at 3 months were reviewed based on these clusters (n = 231). The cluster solution was analysed using defined food groups in serves and with respect to clinical parameters and requirements for selected nutrients. RESULTS: Two distinct dietary patterns were identified from the reported baseline dietary intakes. Subjects in Cluster 1 reported food patterns characterised by higher intakes of low-fat dairy and unsaturated oils and margarine and were generally more closely aligned to food choices encouraged in national dietary guidelines. Subjects in Cluster 2 reported a dietary pattern characterised by non-core foods and drinks, higher-and medium-fat dairy foods, fatty meats and alcohol. At 3 months, Cluster 2 subjects reported greater reductions in energy intake (-5317 kJ; P<0.001) and greater weight loss (-5.6 kg; P<0.05) compared with Cluster 1. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight subjects with reported dietary patterns similar to dietary guidelines at baseline may have more difficulty in reducing energy intake than those with poor dietary patterns. Correcting exposure to non-core foods and drinks was key to successful weight loss.

In milk and dairy products the reported levels are between 1.50% and 5.20%, in meat and derived products between 0.20% and 21,30%; in chocolates from 0% to 15, 70%. The greatest variability is found in margarines, where a variety has been reported from ""trans-free products"" to products containing up to 34.30%.

Trans fatty acids are incorporated in several lipids and accumulate in the membrane of cells. Here we systematically investigate whether the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is affected by trans fatty acids compared to the cis conformation. Our experiments clearly show that trans fatty acids compared to cis fatty acids increase amyloidogenic and decrease nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, resulting in an increased production of amyloid beta (A beta) peptides, main components of senile plaques, which are a characteristic neuropathological hallmark for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, our results show that oligomerization and aggregation of A beta are increased by trans fatty acids. The mechanisms identified by this in vitro study suggest that the intake of trans fatty acids potentially increases the AD risk or causes an earlier onset of the disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: England. Subjects: Representative sample of 15 809 adults aged 16 y and older. Data analysed for 9772 non-diabetic, white European subjects. Main outcome measures: Glycated haemoglobin (GHb). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip circumference ratio, activity level, and educational attainment. Results: After adjusting for confounding, GHb was 0.277% (95% confidence interval 0.218 to 0.336) higher in current smokers of 20 or more per day, compared with non-smokers. GHb was 0.189% (0.101 to 0.277) lower in those drinking 42 or more units of alcohol per week than in non-drinkers. GHb was not associated with frequency of consumption of pulses, fruit, vegetables and salads, cakes, bread or confectionery. GHb was higher in subjects who took sugar in tea (0.051%, 0.015 to 0.087%) or in coffee (0.069%, 0.034 to 0.105%).

Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces 5(3): 924-933."	0	"This article describes the separation of mixtures of fatty acid salts using a new organic solvent nanofiltration membrane based on polydicyclopentadiene (PDCPD). Mixtures of free fatty acids could not be separated by the membranes because they permeated at similar rates. When triisobutylamine was added to the fatty acids, the cis-fatty acid salts (oleic, petroselinic, vaccenic, linoleic, and linolenic acid) had slower permeation though the membranes than saturated (stearic acid) and trans-fatty acid (elaidic acid) salts. The reason for the difference in permeation was due to the formation of stable salt pairs between the amine and fatty acids that increased their cross-sectional areas. The fatty acid salts derived from saturated and trans-fatty acids were smaller than the critical area cutoff for the PDCPD membranes, so they readily permeated. In contrast, the fatty acid salts derived from the cis-fatty acids had critical areas larger than critical area cutoff of the PDPCD membranes and had slowed permeation. The partitioning coefficients of fatty acids and fatty acid salts were investigated to demonstrate that they were not responsible for the difference in permeation. The use of pressure was investigated to greatly accelerate the permeation through the membranes. For a solvent mixture of 35/65 (v/v) toluene/hexanes, the permeation of solvent was approximately 39 L m(-2) h(-1). This value is similar to values reported for permeation through membranes used in industry. The separation of a mixture of fatty acids based on the composition of soybean oil was investigated using pressure. The saturated fatty acid salts were almost completely removed from the cis-fatty acid salts when iBu(3)N was used as the amine to form the salt pairs. The separation of the cis-fatty acids found in soybean oil was investigated with Pr3N as the amine. The oleic acid salt (oleic acid has one cis double bond) preferentially permeated the membrane while the linoleic (two cis double bonds) and linolenic (three cis double bonds) salts were partly retained. The separation of fatty acids using membranes may have real applications in industry to purify fatty acids on a large scale.""Gupta, A. K., et al. (2011).

In this study, NMR and LC-MS untargeted metabolomics has been used as an approach to explore the impact of TFA intake on plasma metabolites. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a double-blinded randomized controlled parallel-group study, 52 overweight postmenopausal women received either partially hydrogenated soybean oil, providing 15.7 g/day of TFA (trans18: 1) or control oil with mainly oleic acid for 16 weeks. Subsequent to the intervention period, the subjects participated in a 12-week dietary weight loss program. Before and after the TFA intervention and after the weight loss programme, volunteers participated in an oral glucose tolerance test. PLSDA revealed elevated lipid profiles with TFA intake. NMR indicated up-regulated LDL cholesterol levels and unsaturation. LC-MS profiles demonstrated elevated levels of specific polyunsaturated (PUFA) long-chain phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and a sphingomyelin (SM) which were confirmed with a lipidomics based method. Plasma levels of these markers of TFA intake declined to their low baseline levels after the weight loss program for the TFA group and did not fluctuate for the control group. The marker levels were unaffected by OGTT. Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates that intake of TFA affects phospholipid metabolism. The preferential integration of trans18: 1 into the sn-1 position of PCs, all containing PUFA in the sn-2 position, could be explained by a general up-regulation in the formation of long-chain PUFAs after TFA intake and/or by specific mobilisation of these fats into PCs. NMR supported these findings by revealing increased unsaturation of plasma lipids in the TFA group. These specific changes in membrane lipid species may be related to the mechanisms of TFA-induced disease but need further validation as risk markers.""Guymer, R. H. and E. W. T. Chong (2006).

To date, smoking is the only proven modifiable risk factor for AMD. Other factors under study include (i) cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, body mass index, and atherosclerosis; and (ii) dietary risk factors including fat and antioxidant intake, but so far these studies have produced conflicting results. Dietary fat in relation to AMD has recently attracted media attention. Despite very limited work supporting an association between vegetable fat and AMD, widespread publicity advocating margarine as a cause of AMD and encouraging use of butter instead has caused confusion and anxiety among sufferers of AMD and the general public, as well as concern among health professionals. The antioxidant carotenoids-lutein and zeaxanthin-found in dark green or yellow vegetables exist in high concentrations in the macula and are hypothesised to play a protective role. Of nine controlled trials of supplementation with carotenoids and other antioxidants, three suggested that various combinations of antioxidants and carotenoids were protective. While a low-fat diet rich in dark green and yellow vegetables is advocated in general, any specific recommendations regarding certain fats or antioxidant supplementation and AMD are not based on consistent findings at this stage.""Guzman, M., et al.

In liver mitochondria, elaidoyl-CoA was a poorer substrate for carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) than oleoyl-CoA. Likewise, incubation of hepatocytes with oleic acid produced a more pronounced stimulation of CPT-I than incubation with trans fatty acids. This was not due to a differential effect of cis and trans fatty acids on acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity and malonyl-CoA levels. Elaidic acid was metabolized by hepatocytes at a higher rate than oleic acid. Surprisingly, compared to oleic acid, elaidic acid was a better substrate for mitochondrial and, especially, peroxisomal oxidation, but a poorer substrate for cellular and very low density lipoprotein triacylglycerol synthesis. Results thus show that trans fatty acids are preferentially oxidized by hepatic peroxisomes, and that the ACC/malonyl-CoA/CPT-I system for coordinate control of fatty acid metabolism is not responsible for the distinct hepatic utilization of cis and trans fatty acids.""Gylling, H. and T.

Cholesterol synthesis (defined by precursors of cholesterol) was markedly reduced by the long-term statin treatment in both groups, but more extensively in the low than high absorption group (P < 0.05), yet the respective serum cholesterol reductions were similar. From among the absorption markers, sitosterol and cholestanol ratios were correspondingly increased more in the love than in the high absorption group. Plant stanol ester margarine consumption, combined with chronic statin treatment, further lowered the serum cholesterol level (P < 0.001) only in the high absorption group. The sum of cholesterol absorption markers was reduced more (P < 0.05) in the high than in the low absorption group, while the non-significant serum cholesterol reduction of the low absorption group was associated with relatively high increase of cholesterol synthesis. Thus, stanol ester margarine combined with chronic simvastatin treatment reduces cholesterol absorption and serum cholesterol more consistently in subjects with high than love baseline absorption of cholesterol. The profile of baseline cholesterol metabolism determines the changes in synthesis and absorption of cholesterol to hypolipidaemic treatments, but affects less differently serum cholesterol level.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cholesterol-lowering efficacy, of a triple therapy combining bile acid malabsorption with the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and absorption. Methods and Results: Eleven consecutive hypercholes, terolemic coronary patients from Lipid Clinics on a low-fat, low-cholesterol baseline diet added simvastatin (20 mg/day) for three months, and then dietary plant stanol ester margarine (2.25 g of stanols/day) for eight weeks; finally, cholestyramine 8 g/day was added for another eight weeks. This was a before-after trial, in which the results of each period were compared with baseline and those of the previous period. Serum lipids were quantitated using commercial kits, and serum sterols by means of gas-liquid chromatography. Simvastatin lowered LDL-C by 39% (p<0.001), and additional stanol ester margarine by a further 13% (p<0.05). The triple treatment led to 67% reduction from baseline (p<0.001), with all LDL-C values being <2.6 mmol/L, and increased high-density, lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 15% (p<0.01).

Conclusions: The massive reduction in LDL and increase in HDL-C obtained using our triple therapy suggests that the combination of stanol ester with only moderate doses of statin and resin makes it possible to control LDL-C levels effectively in hypercholesterolemic subjects.""Gylling, H. and T. A. Miettinen (2005). ""The effect of plant stanol- and sterol-enriched foods on lipid metabolism, serum lipids and coronary heart disease."" Annals of Clinical Biochemistry 42: 254-263."	0	"Phytosterols are plant sterols, mainly campesterol and sitosterol, and their respective stanols (5 alpha-saturated derivatives), which chemically resemble cholesterol. They are present in a normal diet and are absorbed proportionally to cholesterol, but to a much lesser extent, such that less than 0.1% of serum sterols are plant sterols. Phytosterols inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, and fat-soluble plant stanol esters were introduced as a functional food for lowering serum cholesterol in the early 1990s; plant sterol esters entered the market at the end of the 1990s. Inhibition of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol stimulates cholesterol synthesis, a factor which limits serum cholesterol lowering to about 10% with phytosterols. Enrichment of the diet with plant stanol esters reduces absorption and serum concentrations of both cholesterol and plant sterols, whereas enrichment of the diet with plant sterol esters, especially in combination with statins, lowers serum cholesterol but increases serum plant sterol levels. Recent studies have suggested that high-serum plant sterol levels may be associated with increased coincidence of coronary heart disease. Estimates of coronary heart disease reduction by 20-25% with plant sterols/stanols is based mainly on short-term studies. Long-term cholesterol lowering, needed for the prevention of coronary heart disease, may be successful with plant stanol esters, which lower serum cholesterol in both genders over at least a year.""Gylling, H. and T.

In addition to LDL-C lowering by 10% with 2 g of plant stanols/day, it effectively reduces serum plant sterols, and some studies suggest, also serum triglycerides. Increasing the plant stanol dose up to 9 g/day, LDL-C lowering is dose dependent and a 17% LDL-C reduction can be reached with the maximal dose, similar to that of ezetimibe. Plant stanol ester consumption reduces the plant sterol content of arterial walls, and in some, but not all studies, it improves endothelial function, a surrogate marker of preclinical atherosclerosis. However, hard end point studies both for plant stanol and plant sterol consumption are not available.""Gylling, H., et al. (1995).

However, treatment of children is problematic. We studied the effects of sitostanol (3 g/day) ester dissolved in rapeseed oil margarine as a hypocholesterolemic agent in one homozygous and 14 heterozygous children with FH maintained on a low cholesterol diet for 6 weeks, using a double-blind crossover design. Absorption and synthesis of cholesterol were evaluated by measuring serum plant sterol and cholesterol precursor proportions to cholesterol by gas-liquid chromatography. The compliance was good, and the children could not distinguish by taste the two margarines without and with sitostanol ester. Sitostanol margarine significantly reduced serum total, intermediate density (IDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 11, 26, and 15%, respectively, and increased HDL/LDL cholesterol ratio by 27%. The proportions of serum Delta(8)-cholestenol, lathosterol, and desmosterol were significantly increased by 36, 19, and 18%, and those of serum cholestanol, campesterol, and sitosterol were significantly decreased by 9, 42 and 29%, respectively, suggesting that cholesterol absorption was decreased and synthesis was compensatorily increased. High basal precursor sterol proportions predicted a high decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. In conclusion, partial replacement of normal dietary fat consumption by sitostanol ester margarine appears to be an effective and safe hypocholesterolemic treatment in children with FH.""Gylling, H., et al.

Circulation 96(12): 4226-4231."	0	"Background Reduction of serum cholesterol decreases mortality in primary and especially in secondary prevention. We investigated how effectively postmenopausal women with a previous myocardial infarction reduced their serum cholesterol with dietary means by using sitostanol ester rapeseed oil margarine, alone and In combination with statins, and to what extent cholesterol metabolism was affected. Methods and Results The first study group consisted of 22 randomly chosen women with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Baseline studies on home diet were followed by double-blind, randomized, cross-over studies on margazine without and with sitostanol (3 g/d) ester for 7 weeks in random order. A second group of 10 women on simvastatin consumed sitostanol ester margarine for 12 weeks. Sitostanol ester margarine lowered serum total cholesterol by 13% (P<.05) and LDL cholesterol by 20% (P<.01). Sitostanol ester margarine reduced total cholesterol in all patients, LDL cholesterol <2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) in 32%, and <3.4 mmol/L (<133 mg/dL) in 73% versus none and 270/c during the home diet (P<.01 for both). Combined with simvastatin, sitostanol still reduced total and LDL cholesterol by 11+/-3% and 16+/-5% (P<.01 for both). Sitostanol reduced absorption (-45%), increased fecal elimination (+45% as neutral sterols), and stimulated synthesis (+39%) of cholesterol. High cholestanol and plant sterol (high cholesterol absorption) and low baseline precursor sterol proportions (low cholesterol synthesis) predicted high decreases in serum cholesterol. Conclusions Dietary use of sitostanol ester margarine normalizes LDL cholesterol in about one third of women with previous myocardial infarction, especially in those with high baseline absorption and low synthesis of cholesterol, and in combination with statins reduces the needed drug dose.""Gylling, H., et al.

Accordingly, in this retrospective study, we evaluated whether plant stanol (3 g/d) ester margarine consumption for 6 and 12 weeks lowers serum cholesterol levels in mildly hypercholesterolemic women without (n = 38) and with (n = 22) coronary heart disease. Design: The study population was selected from two of our earlier studies correspondingly matched for age, body mass index, and serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In addition, the long-term effect (12 months) of plant stanol ester with a dose reduction after 6 months (from 3 to 2 g stanol/d) was studied in the noncoronary group. Results: At baseline, the coronary and noncoronary groups had similar serum lathosterol (synthesis marker) and campesterol and sitosterol (absorption markers) ratios to cholesterol, but high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower and serum squalene and desmosterol ratios to cholesterol were significantly higher in the coronary versus noncoronary groups. Short-term plant stanol ester consumption reduced serum cholesterol by 8.7% (P < 0.001) in the coronary group from the control margarine period, and in the noncoronary group by 11% from the control group (P < 0.001). The cholesterol-lowering effect sustained unchanged in the noncoronary subjects during 1 year consumption despite reduction of the plant stanol intake from 3 g/d to 2 g/d. Conclusion: Plant stanol ester margarine consumption effectively reduced serum cholesterol in postmenopausal women with and without coronary artery disease in short-term and for at least 1 year in the noncoronary group, suggesting that stanol ester margarine might be used in the long term for cholesterol lowering in women.""Gylling, H., et al. (2014). ""Plant sterols and plant stanols in the management of dyslipidaemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease."" Atherosclerosis 232(2): 346-360."	0	"Objective: This EAS Consensus Panel critically appraised evidence relevant to the benefit to risk relationship of functional foods with added plant sterols and/or plant stanols, as components of a healthy lifestyle, to reduce plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and thereby lower cardiovascular risk. Methods and results: Plant sterols/stanols (when taken at 2 g/day) cause significant inhibition of cholesterol absorption and lower LDL-C levels by between 8 and 10%. The relative proportions of cholesterol versus sterol/stanol levels are similar in both plasma and tissue, with levels of sterols/stanols being 500-/10,000-fold lower than those of cholesterol, suggesting they are handled similarly to cholesterol in most cells. Despite possible atherogenicity of marked elevations in circulating levels of plant sterols/stanols, protective effects have been observed in some animal models of atherosclerosis. Higher plasma levels of plant sterols/stanols associated with intakes of 2 g/day in man have not been linked to adverse effects on health in long-term human studies. Importantly, at this dose, plant sterol/stanol-mediated LDL-C lowering is additive to that of statins in dyslipidaemic subjects, equivalent to doubling the dose of statin. The reported 6-9% lowering of plasma triglyceride by 2 g/day in hyper-triglyceridaemic patients warrants further evaluation. Conclusion: Based on LDL-C lowering and the absence of adverse signals, this EAS Consensus Panel concludes that functional foods with plant sterols/stanols may be considered 1) in individuals with high cholesterol levels at intermediate or low global cardiovascular risk who do not qualify for pharmacotherapy, 2) as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy in high and very high risk patients who fail to achieve LDL-C targets on statins or are statin-intolerant, 3) and in adults and children (>6 years) with familial hypercholesterolaemia, in line with current guidance. However, it must be acknowledged that there are no randomised, controlled clinical trial data with hard end-points to establish clinical benefit from the use of plant sterols or plant stanols.

The meat samples (longissimus thoracis (LT)) originated from pigs fed different dietary fat sources (animal fat, soybean oil or linseed oil) and thus had different FA compositions before frying. Pan-frying resulted in considerable increases in the meat total-FA content, although this was not always significant and highly variable, despite standardisation of the frying process. The FA composition of the pan-fried meat tended to become similar to that of the culinary fat used, and the extent of changes in the content of a particular FA was relative to the FA gradient from the culinary fat to the meat. However, this was also dependent on the culinary fat used, since frying in olive oil appeared to affect the FA composition of the meat more than did frying in the other culinary fats. Differences in FA composition of meat resulting from different animal feeding treatments remained unchanged after pan-frying without fat, they became smaller after frying in margarine and PUFA-enriched culinary fat, whereas frying in olive oil largely masked the initial FA profile differences. Long chain PUFA (LCPUFA) in the meat were not significantly lost by the frying process, but their proportion was influenced by the uptake of the culinary fat. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

There are more than 50 kinds of rare sugars while naturally abundant monosaccharides such as D-glucose and D-fructose are very few in number. The rare sugars in a ring-form are called an ""Izumoring"". There are three different Izumorings: tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses. A scheme was drawn for the production of ketohexoses based upon the network composed of the four groups comprising all of the ketohexoses and hexitols. A symmetric Izumoring comprising of 16 aldohexoses, 8 ketohexoses, and 10 hexitols were drawn. All the compounds were connected to each other by enzyme reactions or by hydrogenation reactions. Rare sugars such as of D-Psicose showed high antioxidative activity and excellent food properties and were promising as a functional dessert for elderly people. Furthermore, rare sugars have the potential to be used in sweeteners and as food products with new functional characteristics to prevent diabetes, arteriosclerosis and obesity by suppression of lipid accumulation and hyperglycemia.""Hall, R.

However, the effect of Australian sweet lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) flour (ASLF) is unknown. This investigation examined the effect of adding ASLF to standard white bread on post-meal glycaemic, insulinaemic and satiety responses and palatability in healthy subjects. Using a randomised, single-blind, cross-over design, 11 subjects consumed one breakfast of ASLF bread and two of standard white bread >= 7 days apart after fasting overnight. Each breakfast also included margarine, jam, and tea with milk and contained 50g available carbohydrate. On each test day, blood samples were taken after fasting, then several times over 2 hours post-prandially, and analysed for plasma glucose and serum insulin. Subjects rated breakfast palatability and perception of satiety. in the fasting state and over 3 hours post-prandially, after which food intake from an ad libitum buffet and for the rest of the day was recorded. Incremental areas under the curves for glucose, insulin and satiety. glycaemic index, insulinaemic index and satiety index were calculated. ASLF addition to the breakfast reduced its glycaemic index (mean +/- SEM; ASLF bread breakfast = 74.0 +/- 9.6. Standard white bread breakfast = 100, P=0.022). raised its insulinaemic index (ASLF bread breakfast = 127.7 +/- 12.0. Standard white bread breakfast = 100 P=0.046), but did not affect palatability, satiety or food intake. ASLF addition resulted in a palatable breakfast; however, the potential benefits of the lowered glycaemic index may be eclipsed by the increased insulinaemic index.""Hallikainen, M. A. and M. I. J.

Objective: We investigated the cholesterol-lowering effects of 2 novel, low-fat stanol ester-containing margarines as part of a low-fat diet recommended for hypercholesterolemic subjects. Design: In a parallel, double-blind study, 55 hypercholesterolemic subjects were randomly assigned after a 4-wk high-fat diet (baseline) to 3 low-fat margarine groups: wood stanol ester-containing margarine (WSEM), vegetable oil stanol ester-containing margarine (VOSEM), and control margarine (no stanol esters). The groups consumed the margarines for 8 wk as part of a diet resembling that of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Step II diet. The daily mean total stanol intake was 2.31 and 2.16 g in the WSEM and VOSEM groups, respectively. Results: During the experimental period, the reduction in serum total cholesterol was 10.6% (P < 0.001) and 8.1% (P < 0.05) greater and in LDL cholesterol was 13.7% (P < 0.01) and 8.6% (P = 0.072) greater in the WSEM and VOSEM groups, respectively, than in the control group. Serum campesterol concentrations decreased 34.5% and 41.3% (P < 0.001) in the WSEM and VOSEM groups, respectively. Serum HDL cholesterol, sitostanol, campestanol, beta-carotene, and fat-soluble vitamin concentrations did not change significantly from baseline. Conclusions: We conclude that the low-fat, plant stanol ester-containing margarines are effective cholesterol-lowering products in hypercholesterolemic subjects when used as part of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. They offer an additional, clinically significant reduction in serum cholesterol concentrations to that obtained with a low-fat diet alone.""Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau, A., et al. (2011).

Treatments consisted of 5 concentrate supplements containing no additional lipid (control), or 29 g/kg of lipid from rapeseed oil (RO), sunflower-seed oil (SFO), camelina-seed oil (CO), or camelina expeller (CE). Cows were offered red clover silage ad libitum and 12 kg/d of experimental concentrates. Treatments had no effect on silage or total dry matter intake, whole-tract digestibility coefficients, milk yield, or milk composition. Plant oils in the diet decreased short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acid (6:0-16:0) concentrations, including odd- and branched-chain fatty acids and enhanced milk fat 18:0 and 18-carbon unsaturated fatty acid content. Increases in the relative proportions of cis 18:1, trans 18:1, nonconjugated 18:2, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk fat were dependent on the fatty acid composition of oils in the diet. Rapeseed oil in the diet was associated with the enrichment of trans 18:1 (Delta 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9), cis-9 18:1, and trans-7,cis-9 CLA, SFO resulted in the highest concentrations of trans-5, trans-10, and trans-11 18:1, Delta 9,11 CLA, Delta 10,12 CLA, and 18:2n-6, whereas CO enhanced trans-13-16 18:1, Delta 11,15 18:2, Delta 12,15 18:2, cis-9,trans-13 18:2, Delta 11,13 CLA, Delta 12,14 CLA, Delta 13,15 CLA, Delta 9,11,15 18:3, and 18:3n-3. Relative to CO, CE resulted in lower 18:0 and cis-9 18:1 concentrations and higher proportions of trans-10 18:1, trans-11 18:1, cis-9,trans-11 CLA, cis-9,trans-13 18:2, and trans-11,cis-15 18:2. Comparison of milk fat composition responses to CO and CE suggest that the biohydrogenation of unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids to 18:0 in the rumen was less complete for camelina lipid supplied as an expeller than as free oil. In conclusion, moderate amounts of plant oils in diets based on red clover silage had no adverse effects on silage dry matter intake, nutrient digestion, or milk production, but altered milk fat composition, with changes characterized as a decrease in saturated fatty acids, an increase in trans fatty acids, and enrichment of specific unsaturated fatty acids depending on the fatty acid composition of lipid supplements.""Han, S.

Dietary fat and cholesterol play an important role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses shown to be involved in atherogenesis. We investigated the effects of diets containing hydrogenated fat on cellular immune response and production of inflammatory cytokines in human subjects with moderately elevated cholesterol levels (LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dl). In a double blind crossover study, 19 subjects consumed three diets, 30% of calories as fat, of which two thirds were provided as soybean oil, soybean oil-based stick margarine, or butter for 32 days, each in a randomized order. Production of proinflammatory mediators, prostaglandin (PG) E-2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha); delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation, and production of IL-2 were determined. Production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha was significantly higher after consumption of stick margarine diet compared with soybean oil diet. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production correlated positively with ratios of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (r = 0.499, P < 0.00 1 and r = 0.29 1, P = 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in DTH response, lymphocyte proliferation, or levels of IL-2 and PGE(2) produced among three groups. Our results indicate that consumption of a diet high in hydrogenated fat does not adversely affect cellular immunity but increases production of inflammatory cytokines that have been associated with the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.""Harnack, L., et al.

Perceived barriers to changing dietary and physical activity behaviors were also examined. Design A convenience sample of Lakota adults was surveyed. Data on consumption of higher-fat foods, fruit and vegetable intake, use of sugar-sweetened beverages, physical activity patterns, and barriers to change in diet and physical activity were collected via in-person interviews. Subjects/setting A total of 219 adults from 2 adjacent reservations in South Dakota participated. Results Higher-fat foods consumed most frequently included margarine and butter (32.0% greater than or equal to 5 times per week); eggs (30.1% greater than or equal to 5 times per week); whole milk (25.7% greater than or equal to 5 times per week); potato chips, corn chips, and popcorn (15.1% greater than or equal to 5 times per week); and bacon and sausage (13.3% greater than or equal to 5 times per week). Few subjects reported consuming fruit on a daily basis. Vegetables were consumed somewhat more frequently. Most subjects reported engaging in mild or moderate physical activities 3 or more times per week, although women were found to engage in moderate and strenuous physical activities less frequently than men. Major barriers to fruit intake included expense (16.4%), quality (14.2%), and availability (13.2%). Barriers to vegetable intake mentioned most frequently included availability (11.4%), cost (10.4%), and quality (9.1%). Taste was the most frequently mentioned barrier to cutting intake of high-fat foods (27.9%). Lack of child care (15.8%), lack of time (14.7%), and safety concerns (14.6%) were the most salient barriers to regular exercise.

The present study examines the impact of elaidic acid (t18:1n-9) and linoelaidic acid (t18:2n-6) on the human aortic endothelial cell functional response. Trans fatty acids predominately incorporated into the phospholipid component while only a minute fraction of the total fatty acids (FA) incorporated into triacylglycerol. Trans fatty acids incorporated into the plasma membranes at the expense of the saturated-FA, stearic, palmitic, and to a lesser extent, myristic acid. Both t18: 1n-9 and t18: 2n-6 induced a pro-inflammatory response by elevating surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Neither oleic nor linoleic evoked a pro-inflammatory phenotype under the maximal 50 mu M treatments. Both TFA and stearic acid increased phosphorylation of the ICAM-1 transcriptional regulator, nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-kappa beta), while oleic and linoleic acids did not appear to alter the phosphorylation status. Elaidic acid minimally affected endothelial cell growth, whereas linoelaidic acid completely inhibited growth at 100 mu M and imparted limited cytotoxicity up to 300 mu M. Stearic acid induced cytotoxicity at concentrations above 75 mu M, while oleic and linoleic acids evoked gradual dose-dependent growth inhibition with cytotoxicity occurring only at linoleic acid concentrations greater than 200 mu M. In conclusion, t18:1n-9 and t18:2n-6 fatty acids effectively incorporated into the phospholipid component of endothelial cells and subsequently induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype.""Haug, A., et al.

The content of oleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, short- and medium chain fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds may promote positive health effects. Full-fat milk has been shown to increase the mean gastric emptying time compared to half-skimmed milk, thereby increasing the gastrointestinal transit time. Also the low pH in fermented milk may delay the gastric emptying. Hence, it may be suggested that ingesting full-fat milk or fermented milk might be favourable for glycaemic ( and appetite?) regulation. For some persons milk proteins, fat and milk sugar may be of health concern. The interaction between carbohydrates ( both natural milk sugar and added sugar) and protein in milk exposed to heat may give products, whose effects on health should be further studied, and the increasing use of sweetened milk products should be questioned. The concentration in milk of several nutrients can be manipulated through feeding regimes. There is no evidence that moderate intake of milk fat gives increased risk of diseases.""Haug, A., et al.

These fatty acids may be considered as functional foods, and the concentration in milk can be increased by e. g. sunflower oil supplementation to the dairy cow feed. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of regular butter with a special butter naturally enriched in c9, t11-CLA and VA on plasma lipids in female growing pigs. The experimental period lasted for three weeks and the two diets provided daily either 5.0 g c9, t11-CLA plus 15.1 g VA or 1.3 g c9, t11-CLA plus 3.6 g VA. Results: The serum concentrations of c9, t11-CLA, VA and alpha-linolenic acid were increased and myristic (14: 0) and palmitic acid (16: 0) were reduced in the pigs fed the CLA+VA-rich butter-diet compared to regular butter, but no differences in plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, LDL particle size distribution or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol were observed among the two dietary treatment groups. Conclusion: Growing pigs fed diets containing butter naturally enriched in about 20 g c9, t11-CLA plus VA daily for three weeks, had increased serum concentrations of alpha-linolenic acid and decreased myristic and palmitic acid compared to pigs fed regular butter, implying a potential benefit of the CLA+ VA butter on serum fatty acid composition. Butter enriched in CLA+ VA does not appear to have significant effect on the plasma lipoprotein profile in pigs.""Hayakawa, K., et al. (2000). ""The role of trans fatty acids in human nutrition.""

""Replacing Trans Fat: The Argument for Palm Oil with a Cautionary Note on Interesterification."" Journal of the American College of Nutrition 29(3): 253S-284S."	2	"To replace dietary trans fatty acids (TFA), two practical options exist: revert to a natural saturated fat without cholesterol (most likely palm oil or its fractions) or move to a newer model of modified fat hardened by interesterification (IE). This review summarizes the relative risks for cardiovascular disease inherent in these options. Interestingly, both types of fat have been the subject of nutritional scrutiny for approximately the last 40 years, and both have positive and negative attributes. Only during that period has palm oil production developed to the point where it has become the major edible oil in world markets, making clinical studies of it an important objective. On the other hand, approximately 25 human studies have fed interesterified fat in one form or another over this period, some for weeks, some as a single meal. Two types of diet designs exist. Several fed a small amount of interesterified fat, usually incorporated within a margarine, and stayed below the radar of biological detection of any abnormal metabolism. A few fed interesterified fat that incorporated stearic acid, as interesterified 18:0 (IE-18:0), even comparing it to trans fat and saturated fat, as a major part of total daily calories to assess its metabolic impact per se. These latter 5 to 6 studies clearly reveal negative biological effects on lipoproteins, blood glucose, insulin, immune function, or liver enzymes when relatively high intake of 1E-18:0 or palmitic acid (1E-16:0) were fed in fats with sn2-saturated fatty acids. High intake of 18:0 in natural fats can depress total lipoproteins, while IE-18:0 and 1E-16:0 at high levels adversely affect lipoprotein metabolism. Still other studies have supplied interesterified fat as a single meal or fed such fat daily only in a single snack, as opposed to incorporating the fat into the entire fat pool consumed at all meals in association with most foods (which is the more physiological approach and more apt to elicit effects). Even in meal studies, 1E-18:0 typically delayed fat absorption postprandially, indicating its effect on fat metabolism originating, in part, in the intestine. Mainly 2 saturated fatty acids (18:0 or 16:0) have been interesterified to harden oils, using the 16:0 from fully hydrogenated palm oil or 18:0 from fully hydrogenated soybean oil as the source material. It is not clear that 1E-16:0 is as problematic as 1E-18:0, but 1E-16:0 has been studied less. Levels between 8% energy (%E) and 12%E from 18:0 as interestedfied fat (the typical diet provides about 2%E-4%E as 18:0 from natural fats) show the most effect. Detection of adverse effects would seem to start around 7%E-8%E as 1E-18:0, but one can assume that effects are initiated, even if undetected, at a lower intake, similar to the situation with TFA. Thus, although an intake of 1%E to 4%E from 1E-18:0 does not appear to influence lipoproteins, it is not necessarily the only system affected. The negative effects of 1E-18:0 may be alleviated or masked by dilution with other fats, especially by adding 18:2-rich polyunsaturated oils to the diet. This is similar to the trans fat story, i.e., if a limited intake of TFA is heavily diluted with other oils, the consumption of TFA fails to be detected as an adverse effect. Accordingly, more research is warranted to determine the appropriateness of interesterified fat consumption, particularly before it becomes insidiously embedded in the food supply similar to TFA and intake levels are achieved that compromise long-term health.""Hedman, M., et al.

Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 90(4): 1942-1952."	0	"Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is associated with elevated cholesterol levels and early-onset atherosclerosis. We assessed the efficacy and safety for up to 2 yr of pravastatin treatment in 19 girls and 11 boys ( age range, 4.1 - 18.5 yr) with HeFH. Pravastatin was started at 10 mg/d, with a forced titration by 10 mg at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months until the target cholesterol level [<= 194 mg/dl (<= 5 mmol/liter)] was reached. By 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment, the total cholesterol levels had, respectively, decreased by 19, 20, 23, 27, and 26%, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels had decreased by 25, 27, 29, 33, and 32% compared with the dietary baseline values. Seventeen percent of patients had lipid deposits ( carotid plaque, xanthomas, or corneal arcus) at baseline, and 27% had deposits at 1 yr. The side effects were mild, and no clinically significant elevations in alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, or creatinine were seen. Growth and pubertal maturation remained normal in all subjects. In conclusion, pravastatin treatment was safe and well tolerated. The efficacy in children with slight or moderate hypercholesterolemia was satisfactory, but in children with severe hypercholesterolemia, it was insufficient.""Henninger, M. and F. Ulberth (1996). ""Trans fatty acids in margarines and shortenings marketed in Austria.""

Wide variations of the TFA contents with respect to intra- and inter-brand differences were observed. Diet margarines contained up to 1% TFA, while TFA concentrations in tub or stick margarines were much higher (15.7 +/- 5.8% and 21.3 +/- 5.3%, respectively). A sub-set of samples was also purchased in 1995 and a general reduction of the TFA content was noticed. Taking into account different market shares of certain margarine types, a weighted average of 15.7% TFA and 6.5% TFA was calculated for the 1991/1992 and the 1995 samples. Based on availability data the amount of TFA supplied with margarines was estimated to be 3.7 g per person per day, while a more accurate method of measuring dietary intakes, i.e. diet history and food frequency data, approximates the amount of TFA supplied with margarines to be 1.5 g per person per day for the 1991/1992 samples and 0.6 g for the 1995 samples.""Henninger, M. and F.

Therefore, the fatty acid composition of 52 canned meat products, 51 dry products (soups and sauces), 51 bakery products and snacks, and 74 ready prepared meals (canned or deep-frozen) was examined by gas/liquid chromatography. Canned meat products or prepared meals are no major sources for dietary TFA. Both product groups provided less than 1 g/100 g meat or serving. Contrary to this, dried food items may contain up to g g TFA/100 g product.""Hermansen, K., et al. (2003). ""Effects of soy and other natural products on LDL : HDL ratio and other lipid parameters: A literature review."" Advances in Therapy 20(1): 50-78."	0	"Abnormal lipid levels contribute significantly to the risk of coronary heart disease, a major cardiovascular disease and a serious health problem. Various dietary and pharmacologic treatments have been devised to reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels. Soy protein, soluble fiber, and plant sterol/ester-containing margarines are promising new food-component candidates that may help to realize this goal. Of particular interest in this context is the LDL:HDL ratio, a strong predictor of cardiac events. This report is a review of more than 50 recent trials to determine how such dietary components and garlic affect the LDL:HDL ratio and other lipid parameters. Consumption of new soy products containing high, fixed levels of isoflavones, cotyledon soy fiber, and soy phospholipids (Abacor(R) and Abalon(R)) significantly reduced the LDL:HDL ratio by up to 27%. Soluble dietary fibers such as psyllium and beta glucan from oat bran had a variable effect on LDL-cholesterol levels in the studies analyzed. Plant sterol esters, when consumed in margarines, lowered the LDL:HDL ratio by up to 22%. On average, Abacor and Abalon reduced the LDL:HDL ratio by 20%, LDL cholesterol by 15%, total cholesterol by 10%, and triglycerides by 6%, and increased HDL cholesterol by 5%. The new soy-based supplements may therefore play a valuable role in reducing cardiovascular risk.""Hernandez, E. R. S., et al. (2007). ""High conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content in milk and dairy products using a dietary supplementation of sunflower seed in cows. Thrombogenic/atherogenic risk issues."" Archivos Latinoamericanos De Nutricion 57(2): 173-178."	0	"This study was undertaken to determine the effect of dietary supplementation of sunflower seed in cows on the chemical composition of milk and dairy products. Cream, butter and butter oil were prepared from milk produced by cows fed a control diet (control products) or diet supplemented with 11.2% sunflour seed (CLA-rich products). Milk samples collected were determined for lactose. A sample of CLArich or control product was determined for fatty acid profile as well as fat, protein and ash contents. The index of atherogenicity (IA) and the index of thrombogenicity (IT) were also calculated. Results revealed that there was no effect of the inclusion of sunflower seed in the diet on the lactose content in milk and total fat, protein and ash contents in the dairy products. Average contents of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and transvaccenic acid (TVA), expressed as g/100g total fatty acid were 0.54 and 1.6, respectively in the control products, and 2 and 6.4, respectively in the CLA-rich products. The content of either CLA or TVA was approximately four fold higher in the latter products. Moreover, CLA-rich products showed considerably low IA and IT, which were, respectively, 38.4 and 25.0% less than those from control products. Fatty acid profiles were unaffected during processing, which demonstrates that CLA is a stable component in the dairy products analyzed. It was concluded that dietary supplementation of sunflower seed in cows increases the CLA and TVA contents in milk, which may contribute to the reduction of the risk of cardiovascular diseases in humans.""Herrera-Meza, M.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of AMF naturally enriched with CLA and VA in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), using sterculic oil to inhibit the conversion of VA into CLA. The administration of AMF to SHR during 7 weeks exerted beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk biomarkers (reduction of insulin, blood lipids, increase of adiponectin). When sterculic oil was included, some parameters were further ameliorated (reduction of insulin, increase of adiponectin). Sterculic oil alone reduced body weight and adiposity, and improved blood pressure, adiponectin and triglyceride levels.""Hissanaga, V. M., et al. (2012).

Revista De Nutricao-Brazilian Journal of Nutrition 25(4): 517-530."	2	"In recent years, several studies have indicated a positive relationship between trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. The World Health Organization manifested the need of decreasing the consumption of these fatty acids, which culminated with the recommendation of their elimination in 2004. Labeling is a measure that helps the population make food choices. This article presents a literature review on trans fatty acids, their formation, health effects and the current measures to control their intake, emphasizing food labeling. The following databases were searched: Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, Science Direct and Lilacs. In addition, national and international government sites covering the period from 1990 to 2012 were consulted. The key words used in Portuguese and English were ""trans fatty acids"", and/or ""hydrogenated fat"", conjugated with ""labeling"", and/or ""regulation"", and/or ""legislation"". Manufacturing, individual and public measures stemming from governmental policies and education can help to reduce the consumption of trans fatty acids. Although Brazilian law requires companies to report the amount of trans fatty acids per serving on their product labels, the way this information is presented is questionable. The effective reduction of trans fatty acids in food products can take considerable time because of the necessary cultural and technological changes. It should be noted that any initiative regarding trans fatty acids is important since it will improve the general population's health.""Ho, C. C., et al. (2007). ""Beneficial effects of plant sterols/stanols-containing milk powder on lipid metabolism in hamsters."" Journal of Food and Drug Analysis 15(2): 191-201."	0	"The effect of plant sterols/stanols-containing milk powder (phytosterol milk powder, PSMP, containing 2.78% phytosterols mixture) on lipid metabolism in hamsters was investigated. One hundred male 7-week-old Golden Syrian hamsters were given free access to regular rodent chow and water for 1 week to acclimatize. Four extremely (10%) over- and underweight hamsters were eliminated. Sixteen hamsters were killed and examined for plasma and liver lipid compositions to establish the baseline. The remaining hamster were randomly divided into 5 groups, each group of hamsters had statistically similar average body weight, but fed with different experimental diets for 4 weeks. All 5 groups of hamsters were fed with high fat, high cholesterol diet containing different ingredients. Regular rodent chow diet was supplemented with 0.5% (w/w) cholesterol and corn/coconut oil mixture (corn oil/coconut oil = 1:1) to raise the final fat content to 15% (w/w) (Group 1 - control group). Group 2 was the positive control (PC) group, which was fed with diet containing 0.72% (w/w) phytosterols (consisted of 75% P-sitosterol and 10% campesterol). Groups 3-5 were the experimental groups, of which 12.95, 25.90 or 64.75% (w/w) PSMP (1x, 2x and 5x PSMP groups) was added to the diet and the phytosterol mixture contents in these diets were 0.36, 0.72 and 1.8% (w/w), respectively. At the end of 4-week feeding period, hamsters were killed and the plasma and hepatic lipid compositions together with the fecal neutral sterol content were determined. No adverse effects of PSMP on growth and health condition in hamsters were found in this experiment. At the highest feeding dose of PSMP (64.75%, w/w), hamsters had the highest body weight gain and the lowest plasma and liver lipid contents. PSMP showed significant effects on lowering the concentrations of plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. It could also lower the atherogenic index (LDL-C/HDL-C), hepatic lipid levels and relative liver weight while raising the fecal cholesterol and phytosterols excretion in the hyperlipidemic hamsters.""Ho, S. S. and S. Pal (2005). ""Margarine phytosterols decrease the secretion of atherogenic lipoproteins from HepG2 liver and Caco2 intestinal cells."" Atherosclerosis 182(1): 29-36."	0	"Several studies in humans have demonstrated the hypocholesterolemic effect of plant sterol consumption. It is unclear whether plant sterols regulate lipoprotein metabolism in the liver and intestines, thereby decreasing the levels of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins. We investigated the effect of the three main phytosterols: stigmasterol, campesterol, and beta-sitosterol on lipoprotein production in HepG2 human liver cells and Caco2 human intestinal cells and the mechanisms involved. Cells were incubated for 24 h with 50 mu mol/L of the different phytosterols or 10 mu mol/L of atorvastatin. Very low-density lipoprotein levels (measured by apolipoprotein (apo) B 100) in HepG2 cells and chylomicron levels (measured by apoB48) in Caco2 cells were measured using western blotting. Intracellular cholesterol levels were measured using gas chromatography. Analysis was carried out using Student's t-test and ANOVA. Secretion levels of apoB100 significantly decreased by approximately 30% after incubation with all phytosterols compared to control. In addition, cholesterol ester (CE) concentrations significantly decreased when HepG2 cells were incubated with the phytosterols compared to control cells. Secretion of apoB48 from intestinal cells significantly decreased by 15% with stigmasterol, 16% with campesterol and 19% beta-sitosterol compared to control. Collectively the data suggests that plant sterols limit lipid (CE) availability in cells. Decreases in circulating levels of LDL and chylomicron remnants seen in humans with the consumption of margarine phytosterols are possibly due to their effect on lipid production in cells and would therefore reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

En a cross-sectional study of patients who underwent coronary angiography, the relationships between TFAs, measured in platelets, and the degree of coronary artery disease (CAD) were examined in 191 non-diabetic patients (134 men and 57 women). The degree of CAD was quantified by using an angiographic scoring system developed to provide an estimate of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis: an 'extent score'. The TFA composition of platelets. including palmitelaidic (16:1 omega 7t). elaidic (18:1 omega 9t), trans-10-octadecaenoic acid (18:1 omega 8t), trans vaccenic (18:1 omega 7t), trans-12-octadecaenoic acid (18:1 omega 6t) and linoelaidic (18:2 omega 6tt) acids, was measured by using gas chromatography and quantified as a percentage of total fatty acids. After adjustment for established CHD risk indicators: including age, gender, cigarette smoking, hypertension and serum total cholesterol concentration, elaidic acid (P = 0.0300) and trans-10-octadecaenoic acid (P = 0.0434) were positively associated with the extent score of CAD.

The results of this study, therefore, provide evidence for an association between particular platelet TFAs and the degree of CAD in the patient population studied."
